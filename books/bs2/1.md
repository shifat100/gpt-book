# Chapter 1: Test of Hypothesis

## 1.1 Introduction to Hypothesis Testing

### What is Hypothesis Testing?

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. In business, managers rarely have access to complete population data due to time, cost, or feasibility constraints. Instead, they collect sample data and use hypothesis testing to make informed decisions about the larger population.

**Business Context:** Imagine you're a quality control manager who needs to verify if a new production process maintains the company's quality standards, or a marketing director who wants to determine if a new advertising campaign has increased customer engagement. Hypothesis testing provides a structured, scientific approach to answer these questions.

### Key Components of Hypothesis Testing

#### 1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

The **null hypothesis** is a statement of "no effect," "no difference," or "status quo." It represents the claim we initially assume to be true and serves as the starting point for our test.

**Characteristics:**
- Always contains an equality sign (=, ≤, or ≥)
- Represents the conservative position
- We either reject it or fail to reject it (never "accept" it)

**Business Examples:**
- H₀: The average customer satisfaction score = 4.0
- H₀: The defect rate ≤ 5%
- H₀: There is no difference between sales performance of two regions

#### 2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)**

The **alternative hypothesis** is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents what we suspect might be true or what we're trying to prove.

**Characteristics:**
- Contains inequality signs (≠, <, or >)
- Represents the research claim or the change we want to detect
- We either reject H₀ in favor of H₁, or fail to reject H₀

**Business Examples:**
- H₁: The average customer satisfaction score ≠ 4.0
- H₁: The defect rate > 5%
- H₁: There is a difference between sales performance of two regions

### The Logic of Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing works on the principle of **proof by contradiction**:

1. We assume the null hypothesis (H₀) is true
2. We collect sample data
3. We calculate the probability of obtaining our sample results if H₀ were true
4. If this probability is very small (unlikely), we reject H₀
5. If this probability is reasonable, we fail to reject H₀

---

## 1.2 Errors in Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis testing, we make decisions based on sample data, not complete population information. This means there's always a possibility of making an incorrect decision.

### Types of Errors

#### **Type I Error (α - Alpha)**

**Definition:** Rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true.

- Also called a "**False Positive**" or "**False Alarm**"
- The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by **α** (alpha)
- α is called the **significance level** of the test
- Common values: α = 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10

**Business Example:**
A pharmaceutical company rejects a batch of medicine thinking it's defective (H₀: batch is good), when in reality it meets quality standards. This leads to unnecessary waste and lost revenue.

#### **Type II Error (β - Beta)**

**Definition:** Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually false.

- Also called a "**False Negative**" or "**Missed Detection**"
- The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by **β** (beta)
- (1 - β) is called the **power of the test**

**Business Example:**
A quality inspector fails to reject a shipment thinking it's acceptable (H₀: shipment is good), when in reality it's defective. This leads to customer complaints and potential safety issues.

### Decision Matrix

Here's a comprehensive table showing all possible outcomes:

| **Reality (Unknown Truth)** | **Decision: Fail to Reject H₀** | **Decision: Reject H₀** |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **H₀ is True** | ✓ Correct Decision (Confidence Level = 1-α) | ✗ **Type I Error** (α) |
| **H₀ is False** | ✗ **Type II Error** (β) | ✓ Correct Decision (Power = 1-β) |

### Understanding the Trade-off

- **Reducing α** (Type I error) makes us more conservative, but increases β (Type II error)
- **Reducing β** (Type II error) makes the test more sensitive, but increases α (Type I error)
- Increasing sample size can reduce both errors simultaneously

### Business Implications

**When Type I Error is More Serious:**
- Launching a new product based on faulty market research
- Approving a risky investment project
- Implementing expensive organizational changes

**When Type II Error is More Serious:**
- Missing early signs of financial fraud
- Failing to detect a defective product before market release
- Not identifying a profitable business opportunity

## 1.3 The General Procedure for Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing follows a systematic **5-step procedure** that ensures consistency and rigor in statistical decision-making.

### **Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

Clearly define both the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁).

**Guidelines:**
- H₀ always contains the equality
- H₁ represents what you're trying to prove
- State hypotheses in terms of population parameters (μ, p, etc.)

**Example:**
- H₀: μ = 50,000 (Average annual sales per store is $50,000)
- H₁: μ ≠ 50,000 (Average annual sales per store is different from $50,000)

### **Step 2: Choose the Significance Level (α)**

Select the probability of Type I error you're willing to accept.

**Common Choices:**
- **α = 0.05** (most common) - 5% risk of false positive
- **α = 0.01** - 1% risk (more conservative, used when Type I error is costly)
- **α = 0.10** - 10% risk (less conservative, used in exploratory research)

**Business Decision:** The significance level should reflect the cost of making a Type I error in your specific business context.

### **Step 3: Select and Calculate the Test Statistic**

Choose the appropriate test statistic based on:
- Sample size (large vs. small)
- What you're testing (mean, proportion, variance)
- Whether population standard deviation is known

**Common Test Statistics:**
- **Z-test:** Large samples (n ≥ 30), known σ
- **t-test:** Small samples (n < 30), unknown σ
- **χ²-test:** Categorical data, goodness of fit
- **F-test:** Comparing variances

**General Formula Structure:**
```
Test Statistic = (Sample Statistic - Hypothesized Parameter) / Standard Error
```

### **Step 4: Determine the Critical Value and Decision Rule**

Based on α and the type of test (one-tailed or two-tailed), find the critical value(s) from the appropriate statistical table.

**Decision Rule:**
- **Reject H₀** if the test statistic falls in the rejection region
- **Fail to reject H₀** if the test statistic falls in the non-rejection region

**Two Approaches:**
1. **Critical Value Approach:** Compare test statistic with critical value
2. **P-value Approach:** Compare p-value with α

### **Step 5: Make a Decision and Interpret Results**

Based on your comparison in Step 4:

**If you reject H₀:**
- State: "There is sufficient evidence to support H₁"
- Provide business interpretation of what this means

**If you fail to reject H₀:**
- State: "There is insufficient evidence to support H₁"
- Note: We never say we "accept" H₀, only that we don't have enough evidence to reject it

**Business Interpretation:** Always translate the statistical conclusion into actionable business language.

## 1.4 One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests

The choice between one-tailed and two-tailed tests depends on your research question and what you're trying to detect.

### **Two-Tailed Test (Non-Directional)**

**When to Use:**
- You want to detect any difference from the hypothesized value
- Direction of difference doesn't matter
- You're testing for equality vs. inequality

**Hypotheses Structure:**
- H₀: μ = μ₀
- H₁: μ ≠ μ₀

**Critical Region:**
The rejection region is split between both tails of the distribution.

**Visual Representation:**
```
             α/2                                    α/2
              ↓                                      ↓
         [Reject H₀]     [Fail to Reject H₀]    [Reject H₀]
    --------|===============================|--------
         -Z(α/2)          0                Z(α/2)
                  
For α = 0.05: Critical values are ±1.96
```

**Business Example:**
A coffee shop chain claims the average customer wait time is 5 minutes. You want to test if the actual wait time is **different** from 5 minutes (either higher or lower).
- H₀: μ = 5 minutes
- H₁: μ ≠ 5 minutes

### **One-Tailed Test (Directional)**

**When to Use:**
- You're only interested in detecting a difference in one specific direction
- The research question is directional
- One direction has no practical significance

#### **Right-Tailed Test (Upper-Tail)**

**Hypotheses Structure:**
- H₀: μ ≤ μ₀
- H₁: μ > μ₀

**Critical Region:**
The entire rejection region is in the right (upper) tail.

**Visual Representation:**
```
                                                    α
                                                    ↓
                    [Fail to Reject H₀]       [Reject H₀]
    ----------------------------------------|--------
                        0                  Z(α)
                  
For α = 0.05: Critical value is +1.645
```

**Business Example:**
A manager claims that after training, employee productivity has **increased** from 50 units per day.
- H₀: μ ≤ 50 units
- H₁: μ > 50 units

#### **Left-Tailed Test (Lower-Tail)**

**Hypotheses Structure:**
- H₀: μ ≥ μ₀
- H₁: μ < μ₀

**Critical Region:**
The entire rejection region is in the left (lower) tail.

**Visual Representation:**
```
         α
         ↓
    [Reject H₀]       [Fail to Reject H₀]
    --------|----------------------------------------
          -Z(α)               0
                  
For α = 0.05: Critical value is -1.645
```

**Business Example:**
A company wants to verify that a new manufacturing process has **reduced** defects from 5%.
- H₀: p ≥ 0.05
- H₁: p < 0.05

### **Critical Values Comparison Table**

| **Significance Level (α)** | **Two-Tailed Test** | **One-Tailed Test** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0.10 | ±1.645 | ±1.28 |
| 0.05 | ±1.96 | ±1.645 |
| 0.01 | ±2.576 | ±2.33 |

**Key Point:** For the same α, the critical value for a one-tailed test is less extreme than for a two-tailed test, making it easier to reject H₀ when we have a directional hypothesis.

---

## 1.5 Large Sample Tests (Z-Test)

When sample size is large (generally **n ≥ 30**), we can use the **Z-test** because the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem).

### 1.5.1 Test Concerning Population Mean

**When to Use:**
- Testing a claim about a single population mean
- Large sample size (n ≥ 30)
- Population standard deviation (σ) known, or use sample standard deviation (s) as estimate

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: μ = μ₀
- H₁: μ ≠ μ₀ (or μ > μ₀, or μ < μ₀)

**Test Statistic Formula:**

$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$

**Where:**
- $\bar{x}$ = Sample mean
- $\mu_0$ = Hypothesized population mean
- $\sigma$ = Population standard deviation (or s = sample standard deviation)
- $n$ = Sample size

**Decision Rule:**
- **Two-tailed:** Reject H₀ if |Z| > Z(α/2)
- **Right-tailed:** Reject H₀ if Z > Z(α)
- **Left-tailed:** Reject H₀ if Z < -Z(α)

---

### 1.5.2 Test Concerning Difference Between Two Means

**When to Use:**
- Comparing means from two independent populations
- Large samples from both populations (n₁ ≥ 30 and n₂ ≥ 30)
- Testing if two groups are significantly different

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (or μ₁ - μ₂ = 0)
- H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (or μ₁ > μ₂, or μ₁ < μ₂)

**Test Statistic Formula:**

$$Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

**Under H₀ (assuming μ₁ - μ₂ = 0):**

$$Z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

**Where:**
- $\bar{x}_1$, $\bar{x}_2$ = Sample means
- $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ = Population standard deviations (or s₁, s₂)
- $n_1$, $n_2$ = Sample sizes

---

### **Worked Example: Comparing Sales Performance Between Two Regions**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**Global Electronics Inc.** operates retail stores in two regions: **Region A (North)** and **Region B (South)**. The company's executive team wants to determine if there is a significant difference in average monthly sales per store between these two regions. The company uses this information to allocate marketing budgets and resources.

**Data Collected:**

| **Region** | **Sample Size** | **Average Monthly Sales** | **Standard Deviation** |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Region A (North) | n₁ = 50 stores | $\bar{x}_1 = \$125,000$ | s₁ = $\$18,000$ |
| Region B (South) | n₂ = 45 stores | $\bar{x}_2 = \$115,000$ | s₂ = $\$20,000$ |

**Test at α = 0.05 significance level.**

---

#### **Solution:**

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

- **H₀:** μ₁ = μ₂ (There is no difference in average monthly sales between the two regions)
- **H₁:** μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (There is a significant difference in average monthly sales between the two regions)

This is a **two-tailed test** because we're testing for any difference, not a specific direction.

---

**Step 2: Choose the Significance Level**

α = 0.05

For a two-tailed test: α/2 = 0.025 in each tail

**Critical values:** Z(α/2) = ±1.96

---

**Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic**

Given:
- $\bar{x}_1 = 125,000$
- $\bar{x}_2 = 115,000$
- $s_1 = 18,000$
- $s_2 = 20,000$
- $n_1 = 50$
- $n_2 = 45$

**Formula:**

$$Z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

**Calculate the denominator (Standard Error):**

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{(18,000)^2}{50} + \frac{(20,000)^2}{45}}$$

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{324,000,000}{50} + \frac{400,000,000}{45}}$$

$$SE = \sqrt{6,480,000 + 8,888,889}$$

$$SE = \sqrt{15,368,889}$$

$$SE = 3,920.47$$

**Calculate the Z-statistic:**

$$Z = \frac{125,000 - 115,000}{3,920.47}$$

$$Z = \frac{10,000}{3,920.47}$$

$$Z = 2.55$$

---

**Step 4: Determine Critical Value and Decision Rule**

**Critical values for α = 0.05 (two-tailed):** ±1.96

**Decision Rule:**
- Reject H₀ if Z > 1.96 or Z < -1.96
- Fail to reject H₀ if -1.96 ≤ Z ≤ 1.96

**Our Calculated Z-value:** Z = 2.55

**Visual Representation:**
```
         α/2=0.025                              α/2=0.025
              ↓                                      ↓
         [Reject H₀]  [Fail to Reject H₀]      [Reject H₀]
    --------|===============================|--------|----
          -1.96           0                1.96    2.55
                                                     ↑
                                            Our Z-value
```

Since **Z = 2.55 > 1.96**, our test statistic falls in the rejection region.

---

**Step 5: Make a Decision and Interpret Results**

**Statistical Decision:**
We **reject the null hypothesis** at the 0.05 significance level.

**Statistical Conclusion:**
There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in average monthly sales between Region A (North) and Region B (South).

**Business Interpretation:**

1. **Finding:** Region A (North) has significantly higher average monthly sales ($125,000) compared to Region B (South) ($115,000), with a difference of $10,000 per store per month.

2. **Practical Significance:** This difference translates to:
   - $10,000 × 12 months = $120,000 additional annual revenue per store in Region A
   - For 50 stores in Region A: $6,000,000 additional annual revenue

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Investigate Success Factors:** Study what makes Region A more successful (demographics, marketing strategies, store locations, management practices)
   - **Best Practices Transfer:** Implement successful strategies from Region A in Region B
   - **Resource Allocation:** Consider whether Region B needs additional marketing support or different pricing strategies
   - **Further Analysis:** Conduct qualitative research to understand regional differences in customer behavior and preferences

4. **Managerial Action:** The executive team should not assume both regions are performing equally. Region-specific strategies may be needed to optimize overall company performance.

### 1.5.3 Test Concerning Attributes (Proportions)

**When to Use:**
- Testing a claim about a population proportion
- Large sample size where np ≥ 5 and n(1-p) ≥ 5
- Data is categorical (yes/no, success/failure, defective/non-defective)

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: p = p₀
- H₁: p ≠ p₀ (or p > p₀, or p < p₀)

**Test Statistic Formula:**

$$Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}$$

**Where:**
- $\hat{p}$ = Sample proportion = x/n
- $p_0$ = Hypothesized population proportion
- $n$ = Sample size
- $x$ = Number of successes in sample

**Business Example Context:**
- Quality control: Testing if defect rate meets standards
- Marketing: Testing if conversion rate has changed
- Customer satisfaction: Testing if satisfaction rate has improved

---

### 1.5.4 Test Concerning Difference Between Two Proportions

**When to Use:**
- Comparing proportions from two independent populations
- Large samples where n₁p₁ ≥ 5, n₁(1-p₁) ≥ 5, n₂p₂ ≥ 5, n₂(1-p₂) ≥ 5
- Testing if two groups have significantly different success rates

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: p₁ = p₂ (or p₁ - p₂ = 0)
- H₁: p₁ ≠ p₂ (or p₁ > p₂, or p₁ < p₂)

**Test Statistic Formula:**

First, calculate the **pooled proportion:**

$$\bar{p} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$

Then calculate the **Z-statistic:**

$$Z = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}$$

**Where:**
- $\hat{p}_1 = x_1/n_1$ = Sample proportion 1
- $\hat{p}_2 = x_2/n_2$ = Sample proportion 2
- $\bar{p}$ = Pooled proportion
- $x_1$, $x_2$ = Number of successes
- $n_1$, $n_2$ = Sample sizes

**Business Example Context:**
- A/B testing: Comparing conversion rates of two website designs
- Marketing campaigns: Comparing response rates of two advertisements
- Quality comparison: Comparing defect rates between two suppliers

## Summary of Z-Test Formulas

| **Test Type** | **Test Statistic Formula** | **When to Use** |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Single Mean** | $Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$ | Test one population mean, n ≥ 30 |
| **Two Means** | $Z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$ | Compare two means, n₁, n₂ ≥ 30 |
| **Single Proportion** | $Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}$ | Test one proportion, large n |
| **Two Proportions** | $Z = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}$ | Compare two proportions, large n₁, n₂ |

## Practice Questions

1. A retail chain claims the average customer spends $75 per visit. A sample of 40 customers shows an average of $82 with a standard deviation of $15. Test at α = 0.05.

2. Two marketing strategies are tested: Strategy A yields 45 conversions out of 200 trials; Strategy B yields 60 conversions out of 250 trials. Is there a significant difference at α = 0.01?

3. A quality standard requires defect rate ≤ 3%. A sample of 500 items shows 20 defects. Has the standard been violated? Test at α = 0.05.
