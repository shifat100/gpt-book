# Chapter 2: Chi-Square Test

## 2.1 Introduction to Chi-Square Distribution

### What is the Chi-Square Test?

The **Chi-Square (χ²) test** is a non-parametric statistical test used to analyze categorical data. Unlike Z-tests and t-tests that deal with means and continuous data, chi-square tests examine frequencies and proportions in categories.

**Non-Parametric Nature:**
- Does not require assumptions about population parameters (μ, σ)
- Does not assume normal distribution of the population
- Works with nominal (categorical) data
- Based on frequency counts rather than measurements

**Business Applications:**
- Market research: Analyzing customer preferences across categories
- Quality control: Testing if defects occur randomly or follow a pattern
- Human resources: Examining relationships between demographics and job satisfaction
- Sales analysis: Testing independence between product types and regions

### The Chi-Square Distribution

The **chi-square distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that is:
- Always positive (χ² ≥ 0)
- Right-skewed (especially for small degrees of freedom)
- Becomes more symmetric as degrees of freedom increase
- Actually a family of distributions, each defined by degrees of freedom (df)

**Visual Characteristics:**
```

    |     df=1
    |    /\

    |  /       \___      df=5
    | /            \___
    |/                 \___ df=10
    |________________________\__________ χ²
    0                                   
```

### Properties of Chi-Square Distribution

**1. Degrees of Freedom (df):**
The shape of the chi-square distribution depends entirely on degrees of freedom.
- For goodness of fit: df = k - 1 (where k = number of categories)
- For test of independence: df = (r - 1)(c - 1) (where r = rows, c = columns)
- For variance test: df = n - 1

**2. Mean and Variance:**
- Mean = df
- Variance = 2 × df
- As df increases, the distribution approaches normal distribution

**3. Non-Negative Values:**
Since χ² is calculated from squared differences, it can never be negative.

**4. Additivity:**
If χ₁² ~ χ²(df₁) and χ₂² ~ χ²(df₂), then χ₁² + χ₂² ~ χ²(df₁ + df₂)

### The Chi-Square Test Statistic

**General Formula:**

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

**Where:**
- $O_i$ = Observed frequency in category i
- $E_i$ = Expected frequency in category i
- The sum is taken over all categories

**Logic:**
- If observed frequencies match expected frequencies closely, χ² will be small
- Large differences between observed and expected produce large χ² values
- Large χ² values suggest the null hypothesis should be rejected

**Critical Point:**
Chi-square tests are typically **right-tailed tests** because we're looking for large deviations (large χ² values) to reject H₀.

---

## 2.2 Goodness of Fit Test

### Concept

The **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test** determines whether observed frequency distribution differs significantly from an expected (theoretical) distribution.

**When to Use:**
- Testing if data follows a specific distribution (uniform, normal, Poisson, etc.)
- Verifying if proportions match claimed values
- Checking if frequencies are evenly distributed across categories

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₀:** The observed frequencies fit the expected distribution
- **H₁:** The observed frequencies do not fit the expected distribution

**Test Statistic:**

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

**Degrees of Freedom:**

$$df = k - 1 - p$$

**Where:**
- k = Number of categories
- p = Number of parameters estimated from the sample

**Decision Rule:**
Reject H₀ if χ² > χ²(α, df) (critical value from chi-square table)

---

### **Worked Example: Testing Product Sales Distribution**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**TechMart Electronics** operates five retail stores in different locations within a city. The company's management believes that sales should be **uniformly distributed** across all five stores (i.e., each store should contribute 20% of total sales). They want to test if the actual sales distribution matches this expectation.

**Data Collected (Last Quarter):**

| **Store** | **Observed Sales (Units)** |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Store A (Downtown) | 145 |
| Store B (Mall) | 168 |
| Store C (Suburban) | 132 |
| Store D (Airport) | 125 |
| Store E (University) | 180 |
| **Total** | **750** |

**Test at α = 0.05 significance level.**

---

#### **Solution:**

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

- **H₀:** Sales are uniformly distributed across all five stores (each store has equal sales)
- **H₁:** Sales are not uniformly distributed across the five stores

---

**Step 2: Choose the Significance Level**

α = 0.05

---

**Step 3: Calculate Expected Frequencies**

Under uniform distribution, each store should have equal expected sales:

$$E_i = \frac{Total\ Sales}{Number\ of\ Stores} = \frac{750}{5} = 150\ units$$

**Expected Frequency Table:**

| **Store** | **Observed (Oᵢ)** | **Expected (Eᵢ)** |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Store A | 145 | 150 |
| Store B | 168 | 150 |
| Store C | 132 | 150 |
| Store D | 125 | 150 |
| Store E | 180 | 150 |
| **Total** | **750** | **750** |

---

**Step 4: Calculate the Chi-Square Test Statistic**

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

**Detailed Calculations:**

| **Store** | **Oᵢ** | **Eᵢ** | **(Oᵢ - Eᵢ)** | **(Oᵢ - Eᵢ)²** | **(Oᵢ - Eᵢ)²/Eᵢ** |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Store A | 145 | 150 | -5 | 25 | 0.167 |
| Store B | 168 | 150 | 18 | 324 | 2.160 |
| Store C | 132 | 150 | -18 | 324 | 2.160 |
| Store D | 125 | 150 | -25 | 625 | 4.167 |
| Store E | 180 | 150 | 30 | 900 | 6.000 |
| **Total** | | | | | **χ² = 14.654** |

$$\chi^2 = 0.167 + 2.160 + 2.160 + 4.167 + 6.000 = 14.654$$

---

**Step 5: Determine Degrees of Freedom**

$$df = k - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$$

**Where:**
- k = 5 (number of stores/categories)
- No parameters estimated from sample, so p = 0

---

**Step 6: Find Critical Value**

From chi-square table:
- df = 4
- α = 0.05
- **Critical value: χ²(0.05, 4) = 9.488**

**Decision Rule:**
Reject H₀ if χ² > 9.488

---

**Step 7: Make a Decision**

**Calculated χ² = 14.654**
**Critical value = 9.488**

Since **14.654 > 9.488**, we **reject the null hypothesis**.

**Visual Representation:**
```
                                    α = 0.05
                                        ↓
           [Fail to Reject H₀]    [Reject H₀]
    --------------------------------|-------|---
                                  9.488  14.654
                                   ↑       ↑
                              Critical  Our χ²
```

---

**Step 8: Interpret Results**

**Statistical Conclusion:**
There is sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that sales are NOT uniformly distributed across the five stores.

**Business Interpretation:**

1. **Findings:**
   - Store E (University) has significantly higher sales (180 units vs. expected 150)
   - Store D (Airport) has significantly lower sales (125 units vs. expected 150)
   - Stores B and C show moderate deviations
   - Store A is very close to expected values

2. **Possible Explanations:**
   - **Store E (University):** Higher student population, younger demographic preferring electronics
   - **Store D (Airport):** Limited foot traffic, focus on travelers rather than local customers
   - Location-specific factors affecting customer base and purchasing patterns

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Inventory Management:** Allocate more inventory to Store E, reduce for Store D
   - **Marketing Strategy:** Develop location-specific marketing campaigns
   - **Resource Allocation:** Adjust staffing levels based on actual demand
   - **Further Investigation:** Conduct customer surveys to understand location preferences
   - **Pricing Strategy:** Consider location-based pricing if market conditions differ
   - **Store Layout:** Study Store E's success factors for potential replication

4. **Action Items:**
   - Redistribute inventory quarterly based on sales patterns
   - Increase marketing budget for underperforming stores
   - Consider opening additional stores near university areas
   - Evaluate whether Store D should focus on travel-specific products

---

## 2.3 Test of Independence

### Concept

The **Chi-Square Test of Independence** determines whether two categorical variables are independent or related. This test examines whether the distribution of one variable differs across levels of another variable.

**When to Use:**
- Testing relationship between two categorical variables
- Analyzing cross-tabulated (contingency table) data
- Determining if variables are associated or independent

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₀:** The two variables are independent (no relationship)
- **H₁:** The two variables are dependent (relationship exists)

**Test Statistic:**

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sum_{j=1}^{c} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$

**Expected Frequency Formula:**

$$E_{ij} = \frac{(Row\ Total_i) \times (Column\ Total_j)}{Grand\ Total}$$

**Degrees of Freedom:**

$$df = (r - 1)(c - 1)$$

**Where:**
- r = Number of rows
- c = Number of columns

**Important Requirement:**
All expected frequencies should be ≥ 5. If not, categories should be combined or Yate's correction applied.

---

### **Worked Example: Gender vs. Product Preference**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**StyleHub Fashion** is launching a new marketing campaign and wants to understand if **gender** influences **product category preference**. The marketing team surveyed 300 customers about their preferred product category. They want to determine if gender and product preference are independent or if there's a significant relationship that should influence their targeted advertising strategy.

**Data Collected:**

| **Gender** | **Clothing** | **Accessories** | **Footwear** | **Row Total** |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Male | 45 | 35 | 40 | 120 |
| Female | 75 | 55 | 50 | 180 |
| **Column Total** | **120** | **90** | **90** | **300** |

**Test at α = 0.05 significance level.**

---

#### **Solution:**

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

- **H₀:** Gender and product preference are independent (no relationship between gender and product category preference)
- **H₁:** Gender and product preference are dependent (there is a relationship between gender and product category preference)

---

**Step 2: Choose the Significance Level**

α = 0.05

---

**Step 3: Calculate Expected Frequencies**

**Formula:** 

$$E_{ij} = \frac{(Row\ Total) \times (Column\ Total)}{Grand\ Total}$$

**Calculations:**

**For Male - Clothing:**
$$E_{11} = \frac{120 \times 120}{300} = \frac{14,400}{300} = 48$$

**For Male - Accessories:**
$$E_{12} = \frac{120 \times 90}{300} = \frac{10,800}{300} = 36$$

**For Male - Footwear:**
$$E_{13} = \frac{120 \times 90}{300} = \frac{10,800}{300} = 36$$

**For Female - Clothing:**
$$E_{21} = \frac{180 \times 120}{300} = \frac{21,600}{300} = 72$$

**For Female - Accessories:**
$$E_{22} = \frac{180 \times 90}{300} = \frac{16,200}{300} = 54$$

**For Female - Footwear:**
$$E_{23} = \frac{180 \times 90}{300} = \frac{16,200}{300} = 54$$

**Expected Frequency Table:**

| **Gender** | **Clothing** | **Accessories** | **Footwear** | **Row Total** |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Male | 48 | 36 | 36 | 120 |
| Female | 72 | 54 | 54 | 180 |
| **Column Total** | **120** | **90** | **90** | **300** |

**Verification:** All expected frequencies ≥ 5 ✓ (Condition satisfied)

---

**Step 4: Calculate the Chi-Square Test Statistic**

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$

**Detailed Calculation Table:**

| **Cell** | **Observed (O)** | **Expected (E)** | **(O - E)** | **(O - E)²** | **(O - E)²/E** |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Male - Clothing | 45 | 48 | -3 | 9 | 0.1875 |
| Male - Accessories | 35 | 36 | -1 | 1 | 0.0278 |
| Male - Footwear | 40 | 36 | 4 | 16 | 0.4444 |
| Female - Clothing | 75 | 72 | 3 | 9 | 0.1250 |
| Female - Accessories | 55 | 54 | 1 | 1 | 0.0185 |
| Female - Footwear | 50 | 54 | -4 | 16 | 0.2963 |
| **Total** | | | | | **χ² = 1.0995** |

$$\chi^2 = 0.1875 + 0.0278 + 0.4444 + 0.1250 + 0.0185 + 0.2963 = 1.0995$$

Rounding: **χ² = 1.10**

---

**Step 5: Determine Degrees of Freedom**

$$df = (r - 1)(c - 1) = (2 - 1)(3 - 1) = 1 \times 2 = 2$$

**Where:**
- r = 2 rows (Male, Female)
- c = 3 columns (Clothing, Accessories, Footwear)

---

**Step 6: Find Critical Value**

From chi-square table:
- df = 2
- α = 0.05
- **Critical value: χ²(0.05, 2) = 5.991**

**Decision Rule:**
Reject H₀ if χ² > 5.991

---

**Step 7: Make a Decision**

**Calculated χ² = 1.10**
**Critical value = 5.991**

Since **1.10 < 5.991**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.

**Visual Representation:**
```
                                              α = 0.05
                                                  ↓
         [Fail to Reject H₀]                [Reject H₀]
    -----------------------------------------|------------
                                          5.991
      ↑
   χ² = 1.10
```

---

**Step 8: Interpret Results**

**Statistical Conclusion:**
There is insufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that gender and product preference are dependent. We fail to reject the hypothesis that gender and product preference are independent.

**Business Interpretation:**

1. **Key Finding:**
   - Gender does NOT significantly influence product category preference
   - Male and female customers show similar preferences across clothing, accessories, and footwear
   - The observed differences are likely due to random variation, not systematic preferences

2. **Marketing Implications:**
   - **Universal Campaigns:** Marketing campaigns do not need to be gender-specific for different product categories
   - **Cost Efficiency:** A single unified campaign can target both genders effectively
   - **Resource Allocation:** No need to allocate different marketing budgets by gender for specific categories
   - **Product Placement:** Store layout and product displays don't need gender-based category segregation

3. **Strategic Recommendations:**
   - Focus marketing differentiation on factors OTHER than gender (age, lifestyle, income, occasion)
   - Develop inclusive, gender-neutral advertising campaigns
   - Emphasize product quality, style, and value rather than gender-specific appeals
   - Test other variables: age groups, income levels, shopping frequency, seasonal preferences

4. **Further Analysis:**
   - Investigate if specific product STYLES within categories show gender preferences
   - Analyze purchase frequency and amount spent by gender
   - Study brand preferences across genders
   - Examine online vs. in-store shopping patterns

5. **Cautionary Note:**
   - While overall category preference is independent of gender, specific items within categories may still show preferences
   - Continue monitoring these patterns as fashion trends evolve
   - Consider conducting more granular analysis at the product level

## 2.4 Corrections and Constraints

### Yate's Correction for Continuity

**What is Yate's Correction?**

Yate's correction is an adjustment applied to chi-square tests when sample sizes are small, particularly in **2 × 2 contingency tables**. Since the chi-square distribution is continuous but we're working with discrete frequency data, this correction compensates for the discontinuity.

**When to Use:**
- 2 × 2 contingency tables (only)
- When expected frequencies are between 5 and 10
- Small sample sizes where normal chi-square may overestimate significance

**Formula with Yate's Correction:**

$$\chi^2_{corrected} = \sum \frac{(|O_i - E_i| - 0.5)^2}{E_i}$$

**Key Difference:**
- Subtract 0.5 from the absolute value of (O - E) before squaring
- This makes the test more conservative (reduces χ² value)
- Makes it harder to reject H₀, reducing Type I error

**Example Setup:**

Consider a 2 × 2 table:

| | **Success** | **Failure** | **Total** |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Group A** | 12 | 8 | 20 |
| **Group B** | 7 | 13 | 20 |
| **Total** | 19 | 21 | 40 |

**Without Yate's Correction:**
$$\chi^2 = \frac{(12-9.5)^2}{9.5} + \frac{(8-10.5)^2}{10.5} + \frac{(7-9.5)^2}{9.5} + \frac{(13-10.5)^2}{10.5}$$

**With Yate's Correction:**
$$\chi^2_{corrected} = \frac{(|12-9.5|-0.5)^2}{9.5} + \frac{(|8-10.5|-0.5)^2}{10.5} + \frac{(|7-9.5|-0.5)^2}{9.5} + \frac{(|13-10.5|-0.5)^2}{10.5}$$

**Business Impact:**
Using Yate's correction in business decisions with small samples helps avoid false positives (Type I errors) that could lead to unnecessary changes in strategy.

### Grouping Categories When Frequencies Are Small

**The Problem:**

Chi-square tests require that **expected frequencies should be at least 5** in each cell. When expected frequencies are too small:
- The chi-square approximation becomes unreliable
- Test results may be invalid
- Risk of incorrect conclusions increases

**Solution: Combine Adjacent Categories**

**Guidelines for Combining Categories:**

1. **Check all expected frequencies first**
2. **Combine logically related categories** (not arbitrary)
3. **Aim for E ≥ 5 in all cells after combination**
4. **Maintain meaningful interpretation**

---

**Example: Customer Age Group Preferences**

**Original Data (Invalid):**

| **Age Group** | **Observed** | **Expected** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 18-25 | 15 | 12 |
| 26-35 | 28 | 30 |
| 36-45 | 22 | 25 |
| 46-55 | 8 | 10 |
| 56-65 | 4 | 8 | ← **Problem: E < 5**
| 66+ | 3 | 5 | ← **Problem: E < 5**

**Problem:** Last two categories have expected frequencies < 5

**Solution: Combine Categories**

| **Age Group** | **Observed** | **Expected** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 18-25 | 15 | 12 |
| 26-35 | 28 | 30 |
| 36-45 | 22 | 25 |
| 46-55 | 8 | 10 |
| **56+** (combined) | **7** | **13** | ✓ **Valid: E ≥ 5**

**After Combination:**
- All expected frequencies ≥ 5
- Test is now valid
- Degrees of freedom: df = (5-1) = 4 instead of (6-1) = 5

---

**Example: Contingency Table with Small Cells**

**Original 3 × 4 Table (Invalid):**

| | **Product A** | **Product B** | **Product C** | **Product D** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Region 1** | 25 | 18 | 3 | 2 |
| **Region 2** | 30 | 22 | 4 | 1 |
| **Region 3** | 28 | 20 | 2 | 3 |

**Problem:** Multiple cells with observed/expected < 5 in last two columns

**Solution: Combine Products C and D**

| | **Product A** | **Product B** | **Product C & D** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Region 1** | 25 | 18 | 5 |
| **Region 2** | 30 | 22 | 5 |
| **Region 3** | 28 | 20 | 5 |

**Result:**
- All frequencies adequate for valid test
- Interpretation: "Other Products" category
- df = (3-1)(3-1) = 4

---

**Business Considerations:**

1. **Logical Combinations:**
   - Combine similar product categories
   - Group adjacent time periods or age ranges
   - Merge related geographic regions

2. **Preserve Meaning:**
   - Don't combine categories that don't make business sense
   - Maintain actionable insights
   - Document what categories were combined

3. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Collect more data to increase frequencies
   - Use Fisher's Exact Test for small 2×2 tables
   - Consider alternative non-parametric tests

4. **Reporting:**
   - Always note when categories were combined
   - Explain the rationale for combinations
   - Acknowledge limitations in interpretation

## 2.5 Tests Concerning Variance

While chi-square is primarily used for categorical data, it also plays a crucial role in tests concerning population variance. This section provides a brief overview of these applications.

### Chi-Square Distribution and Variance

When dealing with a single population variance, the test statistic follows a chi-square distribution:

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$$

**Where:**
- n = Sample size
- s² = Sample variance
- σ₀² = Hypothesized population variance
- df = n - 1

---

### Confidence Interval for Population Variance

A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the population variance σ².

**Formula:**

$$\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{\alpha/2}} < \sigma^2 < \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha/2}}$$

**For Population Standard Deviation (σ):**

$$\sqrt{\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{\alpha/2}}} < \sigma < \sqrt{\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha/2}}}$$

**Important Note:**
- Use χ²(α/2) for the LOWER bound (in the denominator, which makes the fraction larger)
- Use χ²(1-α/2) for the UPPER bound (in the denominator, which makes the fraction smaller)
- This is counterintuitive but correct!

---

**Example: Quality Control Variance**

**Scenario:** A manufacturing process has a sample of n = 20 products with sample standard deviation s = 2.5 mm. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population variance.

**Given:**
- n = 20
- s = 2.5 mm
- s² = 6.25
- α = 0.05
- df = 19

**Critical Values from Chi-Square Table:**
- χ²(0.025, 19) = 32.852 (for lower bound)
- χ²(0.975, 19) = 8.907 (for upper bound)

**Calculation:**

**Lower bound:**
$$\frac{(20-1) \times 6.25}{32.852} = \frac{118.75}{32.852} = 3.614$$

**Upper bound:**
$$\frac{(20-1) \times 6.25}{8.907} = \frac{118.75}{8.907} = 13.333$$

**95% Confidence Interval for σ²:**
$$(3.614, 13.333)\ mm^2$$

**For Standard Deviation (σ):**
$$(\sqrt{3.614}, \sqrt{13.333}) = (1.90, 3.65)\ mm$$

**Business Interpretation:**
We are 95% confident that the true population standard deviation of the manufacturing process is between 1.90 mm and 3.65 mm. If the specification requires σ < 2.0 mm, this process may not meet requirements consistently.

---

### Hypothesis Test for Population Variance

**One-Sample Variance Test:**

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: σ² = σ₀² (variance equals claimed value)
- H₁: σ² ≠ σ₀² (two-tailed) or σ² > σ₀² or σ² < σ₀² (one-tailed)

**Test Statistic:**

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$$

**Decision Rules:**

**Two-tailed test:**
- Reject H₀ if χ² > χ²(α/2, df) or χ² < χ²(1-α/2, df)

**Right-tailed test (H₁: σ² > σ₀²):**
- Reject H₀ if χ² > χ²(α, df)

**Left-tailed test (H₁: σ² < σ₀²):**
- Reject H₀ if χ² < χ²(1-α, df)

---

**Business Example: Testing Process Consistency**

**Scenario:** A call center claims their average call handling time has a standard deviation of σ = 3 minutes. A sample of 25 calls shows s = 4.2 minutes. Test at α = 0.05 if the variability has increased.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Hypotheses**
- H₀: σ² = 9 (σ = 3)
- H₁: σ² > 9 (variability has increased) - **Right-tailed test**

**Step 2: Significance Level**
α = 0.05

**Step 3: Calculate Test Statistic**

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2} = \frac{(25-1)(4.2)^2}{(3)^2} = \frac{24 \times 17.64}{9} = \frac{423.36}{9} = 47.04$$

**Step 4: Critical Value**
- df = 24
- α = 0.05 (right-tailed)
- Critical value: χ²(0.05, 24) = 36.415

**Step 5: Decision**
χ² = 47.04 > 36.415

**Reject H₀**

**Conclusion:**
There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the variability in call handling time has increased significantly beyond the claimed 3 minutes. The call center needs to investigate causes of inconsistency and implement standardization measures.

### Comparing Two Population Variances (F-Test Preview)

While the chi-square test handles a single variance, comparing two variances requires the **F-test** (covered in detail in later chapters).

**Brief Overview:**

$$F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}$$

Where the larger variance is typically placed in the numerator.

**Business Application:**
- Comparing consistency between two production lines
- Testing if one supplier has more variable quality than another
- Evaluating if a new process reduces variability compared to the old process

## Summary of Chi-Square Tests

| **Test Type** | **Purpose** | **Formula** | **Degrees of Freedom** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Goodness of Fit** | Test if observed fits expected distribution | $\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$ | k - 1 - p |
| **Independence** | Test relationship between two categorical variables | $\chi^2 = \sum \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$ | (r-1)(c-1) |
| **Variance Test** | Test claim about population variance | $\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$ | n - 1 |

## Key Assumptions and Requirements

**For All Chi-Square Tests:**

1. **Random Sampling:** Data collected through random sampling
2. **Independence:** Observations are independent
3. **Sample Size:** Adequate sample size for test validity

**For Categorical Data Tests:**

4. **Expected Frequencies:** All expected frequencies should be ≥ 5
   - If not, combine categories or use Yate's correction
5. **Mutually Exclusive Categories:** Each observation in only one category

**For Variance Tests:**

6. **Normality:** Population should be approximately normally distributed
   - Chi-square test for variance is sensitive to non-normality
   - More critical than for mean tests

## Key Takeaways from Chapter 2

1. **Chi-square tests** are non-parametric tests ideal for categorical data and variance analysis.

2. **Goodness of Fit Test** determines if observed frequencies match an expected distribution.

3. **Test of Independence** examines relationships between two categorical variables using contingency tables.

4. **Expected frequency rule:** All cells must have E ≥ 5 for valid results; combine categories if needed.

5. **Yate's Correction** provides a more conservative test for small 2 × 2 tables.

6. **Variance tests** use chi-square distribution to make inferences about population variability.

7. **Business decisions** should consider both statistical significance and practical significance.

8. Always check assumptions before applying chi-square tests.

## Practice Questions

**1. Goodness of Fit:**
A restaurant manager believes customer visits are evenly distributed across five days (Mon-Fri). Observed: Mon=45, Tue=52, Wed=48, Thu=55, Fri=50. Test at α = 0.05.

**2. Test of Independence:**
Test if job satisfaction (High/Medium/Low) is independent of department (Sales/Operations/HR) using the following data:

| | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sales** | 25 | 15 | 10 |
| **Operations** | 20 | 25 | 15 |
| **HR** | 15 | 10 | 5 |

**3. Variance Test:**
A quality standard requires σ ≤ 0.5 cm. A sample of 30 items has s = 0.62 cm. Test at α = 0.05 if the standard is violated.

**4. Small Frequencies:**
Given a 2 × 3 table where two cells have expected frequency = 3, explain what action you would take and why.
