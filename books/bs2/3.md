# Chapter 3: Correlation Analysis

## 3.1 Introduction to Correlation

### What is Correlation?

**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. In business, understanding how variables relate to each other is crucial for decision-making, forecasting, and strategy development.

**Business Context:**
- Does advertising spending increase sales?
- Is employee satisfaction related to productivity?
- Do interest rates affect housing prices?
- Is customer age associated with purchase frequency?

Correlation analysis helps answer these questions by quantifying the relationship between variables.

### The Nature of Relationships

When we study two variables, we're interested in:
1. **Direction:** Do they move together or in opposite directions?
2. **Strength:** How closely are they related?
3. **Form:** Is the relationship linear or non-linear?

**Important Terminology:**
- **Independent Variable (X):** The predictor or explanatory variable
- **Dependent Variable (Y):** The response or outcome variable
- **Bivariate Data:** Data involving two variables measured on the same individuals or units

## 3.2 Correlation vs. Causation

### A Critical Distinction

One of the most important concepts in statistics is understanding the difference between correlation and causation.

### **Correlation**

**Definition:** A statistical relationship where two variables tend to change together.

**Characteristics:**
- Measures association, not cause-and-effect
- Can be measured and quantified
- May be due to various underlying factors
- Represented by correlation coefficient (r)

**Example:** Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are positively correlated.
- Both increase in summer
- This doesn't mean ice cream causes drowning!

### **Causation**

**Definition:** A relationship where changes in one variable directly cause changes in another variable.

**Characteristics:**
- Implies a cause-and-effect relationship
- Requires experimental evidence or strong theoretical basis
- Must rule out alternative explanations
- Typically established through controlled experiments

**Example:** Smoking causes lung cancer.
- Supported by controlled studies
- Biological mechanism identified
- Alternative explanations ruled out

### Why Correlation ≠ Causation

**Three possible explanations for correlation:**

**1. X causes Y**
- Advertising spending (X) → Sales increase (Y)
- Direct causal relationship

**2. Y causes X (Reverse Causation)**
- Company profits (Y) → Increased advertising budget (X)
- The relationship is reversed

**3. Third Variable (Confounding Factor)**
- Both X and Y are caused by Z
- Ice cream sales (X) and drowning (Y) both caused by hot weather (Z)

### **The Confounding Variable Problem**

```
     Temperature (Z)
         /      \
        /        \
       ↓          ↓
Ice Cream    Drowning
  Sales        Incidents
    (X)          (Y)
    
X and Y are correlated, but neither causes the other.
Both are caused by Z (temperature/summer season).
```

### Business Examples of Correlation Without Causation

**Example 1: Shoe Size and Reading Ability**
- **Observation:** Children with larger shoe sizes read better
- **Correlation:** Positive
- **Causation:** NO - Age is the confounding variable
- **Explanation:** Older children have bigger feet AND better reading skills

**Example 2: Number of Fire Trucks and Fire Damage**
- **Observation:** More fire trucks at a scene correlates with more damage
- **Correlation:** Positive
- **Causation:** Fire trucks don't cause damage!
- **Explanation:** Larger fires require more trucks AND cause more damage (fire size is confounding variable)

**Example 3: Company Website Traffic and Revenue**
- **Observation:** Companies with more website traffic have higher revenue
- **Correlation:** Positive
- **Causation:** Complex - could be bidirectional
- **Explanation:** 
  - More traffic might lead to more sales (X → Y)
  - Successful companies invest more in marketing, driving traffic (Y → X)
  - Brand strength drives both traffic and sales (Z → X and Y)

### Establishing Causation in Business Research

**Requirements for Causal Claims:**

1. **Temporal Precedence:** Cause must occur before effect
2. **Covariation:** Variables must be correlated
3. **No Alternative Explanations:** Rule out confounding variables
4. **Theoretical Mechanism:** Explain HOW X causes Y
5. **Experimental Evidence:** Randomized controlled trials when possible

**Business Application:**
Before making causal claims based on correlation:
- Conduct controlled experiments (A/B testing)
- Control for confounding variables
- Use longitudinal data (time-series analysis)
- Apply business logic and theory
- Replicate findings across different contexts

**Managerial Implication:**
Just because two metrics are correlated doesn't mean changing one will change the other. Always investigate the underlying mechanism before making strategic decisions based on correlations.

## 3.3 Types of Correlation

Correlation can be classified based on the **direction** and **strength** of the relationship between variables.

### 3.3.1 Based on Direction

#### **1. Positive Correlation**

**Definition:** When two variables move in the same direction - as one increases, the other also increases; as one decreases, the other also decreases.

**Correlation Coefficient:** 0 < r ≤ +1

**Business Examples:**
- **Advertising expenditure and sales revenue:** More advertising typically leads to more sales
- **Employee training hours and productivity:** More training generally improves performance
- **Price and perceived quality:** Higher prices often associated with higher perceived quality
- **Education level and income:** Higher education typically correlates with higher earnings
- **Customer satisfaction and repeat purchases:** Happy customers buy again

**Visual Pattern:**
```
Y |        ●
  |      ●   ●
  |    ●   ●
  |  ●   ●
  |●   ●
  |________________ X
  
Points trend upward from left to right
```

#### **2. Negative Correlation**

**Definition:** When two variables move in opposite directions - as one increases, the other decreases; as one decreases, the other increases.

**Correlation Coefficient:** -1 ≤ r < 0

**Business Examples:**
- **Price and quantity demanded:** Higher prices typically reduce demand
- **Product quality and defect rate:** Better quality means fewer defects
- **Distance from store and shopping frequency:** Customers living farther away visit less often
- **Interest rates and housing sales:** Higher rates reduce home purchases
- **Employee turnover and job satisfaction:** Happier employees leave less frequently

**Visual Pattern:**
```
Y |●
  |  ●   ●
  |    ●   ●
  |      ●   ●
  |        ●
  |________________ X
  
Points trend downward from left to right
```

#### **3. Zero Correlation (No Correlation)**

**Definition:** No linear relationship exists between the two variables - changes in one variable do not correspond to changes in the other.

**Correlation Coefficient:** r ≈ 0

**Business Examples:**
- **Employee shoe size and sales performance:** No logical connection
- **Product color and durability:** Unrelated attributes
- **Day of the week and annual revenue (for most businesses):** No systematic relationship
- **Manager's height and department profitability:** No causal or logical link

**Visual Pattern:**
```
Y |  ●   ●     ●
  |    ●   ●
  |●     ●     ●
  |  ●     ●
  |    ●   ●   ●
  |________________ X
  
Points scattered randomly with no pattern
```

### 3.3.2 Based on Strength

The **absolute value** of the correlation coefficient indicates strength:

| **|r| Value** | **Strength** | **Interpretation** |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0.00 - 0.19 | Very Weak | Almost no relationship |
| 0.20 - 0.39 | Weak | Slight relationship |
| 0.40 - 0.59 | Moderate | Noticeable relationship |
| 0.60 - 0.79 | Strong | Substantial relationship |
| 0.80 - 1.00 | Very Strong | Very strong relationship |

**Examples:**
- r = +0.85: Strong positive correlation
- r = -0.92: Very strong negative correlation
- r = +0.15: Very weak positive correlation
- r = -0.45: Moderate negative correlation

### 3.3.3 Perfect Correlation

#### **Perfect Positive Correlation (r = +1)**

**Definition:** All data points lie exactly on a straight line with positive slope.

**Characteristics:**
- Y increases proportionally with X
- Perfect predictability
- Rarely occurs in real business data

**Example:**
```
Y |           ●
  |         ●
  |       ●
  |     ●
  |   ●
  | ●
  |________________ X
  
All points on a perfect straight line
```

**Business Context:** Total revenue = Price × Quantity (when price is constant)

#### **Perfect Negative Correlation (r = -1)**

**Definition:** All data points lie exactly on a straight line with negative slope.

**Characteristics:**
- Y decreases proportionally as X increases
- Perfect inverse relationship
- Also rare in business applications

**Example:**
```
Y | ●
  |   ●
  |     ●
  |       ●
  |         ●
  |           ●
  |________________ X
  
All points on a perfect downward-sloping line
```

### 3.3.4 Curvilinear (Non-Linear) Relationships

**Important Note:** Correlation coefficients measure **linear relationships only**. Variables can have strong non-linear relationships but show weak linear correlation.

**Example: Quadratic Relationship**
```
Y |    ●     ●
  |  ●         ●
  |●             ●
  |________________ X
  
U-shaped curve: r might be near 0
but a strong non-linear relationship exists
```

**Business Examples:**
- **Product price and revenue:** Too low = low revenue; optimal price = maximum revenue; too high = low revenue (inverted U-shape)
- **Stress and performance:** Moderate stress improves performance; too much stress hurts performance (inverted U-shape)
- **Advertising saturation:** Initial ads very effective; diminishing returns with more ads (logarithmic)

**Key Point:** Always visualize data with scatter plots before relying solely on correlation coefficients!

## 3.4 Scatter Diagrams (Scatter Plots)

### What is a Scatter Diagram?

A **scatter diagram** (or scatter plot) is a graphical representation of the relationship between two quantitative variables. Each point represents one observation with its X and Y values plotted as coordinates.

**Purpose:**
- Visualize the relationship between variables
- Identify patterns, trends, or outliers
- Assess whether correlation analysis is appropriate
- Detect non-linear relationships

### Components of a Scatter Diagram

```

### Creating Effective Scatter Diagrams

**Best Practices:**

1. **Axis Selection:**
   - X-axis: Independent variable (presumed cause)
   - Y-axis: Dependent variable (presumed effect)

2. **Scaling:**
   - Use appropriate scales to avoid distortion
   - Start axes at zero when meaningful
   - Ensure full range of data is visible

3. **Labeling:**
   - Clear axis labels with units
   - Descriptive title
   - Legend if multiple groups are plotted

4. **Point Clarity:**
   - Use appropriate point size
   - Avoid overlapping (use transparency if needed)
   - Consider color coding for categories

### Business Applications of Scatter Diagrams

**1. Quality Control:**
- Plot defect rates vs. production speed
- Identify optimal operating conditions

**2. Marketing Analysis:**
- Visualize relationship between marketing spend and customer acquisition
- Identify diminishing returns

**3. Human Resources:**
- Examine relationship between experience and performance
- Identify training needs

**4. Financial Analysis:**
- Plot stock returns vs. market returns (Beta calculation)
- Identify risk-return relationships

**5. Operations Management:**
- Analyze relationship between inventory levels and stock-outs
- Optimize inventory policies

### Red Flags in Scatter Diagrams

**Watch for:**
1. **Outliers:** Extreme points that don't fit the pattern
2. **Clusters:** Distinct groups suggesting subpopulations
3. **Non-linearity:** Curved patterns requiring different analysis
4. **Heteroscedasticity:** Variance changes across X values
5. **Restricted Range:** Limited data range may hide true relationship

**Action:** Always create a scatter diagram BEFORE calculating correlation coefficients!

## 3.5 Karl Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation

### Introduction

**Karl Pearson's Correlation Coefficient** (also called **Pearson's r** or **product-moment correlation coefficient**) is the most widely used measure of linear correlation between two continuous variables.

**Developed by:** Karl Pearson (1896)

**Symbol:** r (for sample) or ρ (rho, for population)

**Range:** -1 ≤ r ≤ +1

### Properties of Pearson's r

1. **Dimensionless:** Has no units (pure number)
2. **Symmetric:** r(X,Y) = r(Y,X)
3. **Affected by outliers:** Extreme values can heavily influence r
4. **Measures linear relationships only:** May miss non-linear associations
5. **Scale independent:** Changing units doesn't change r

### Formula for Pearson's r

**Computational Formula (Most Common):**

$$r = \frac{n\sum XY - \sum X \sum Y}{\sqrt{[n\sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2][n\sum Y^2 - (\sum Y)^2]}}$$

**Where:**
- n = Number of paired observations
- X = Values of first variable
- Y = Values of second variable
- ΣXY = Sum of products of paired values
- ΣX = Sum of X values
- ΣY = Sum of Y values
- ΣX² = Sum of squared X values
- ΣY² = Sum of squared Y values

**Alternative Formula (Definitional):**

$$r = \frac{\sum(X - \bar{X})(Y - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum(X - \bar{X})^2 \sum(Y - \bar{Y})^2}}$$

**Covariance Form:**

$$r = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{s_X \cdot s_Y}$$

Where Cov(X,Y) is the covariance, and s_X, s_Y are standard deviations.

### Interpretation of r Values

| **r Value** | **Interpretation** | **Business Meaning** |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| r = +1.0 | Perfect positive correlation | Perfect predictability; Y increases exactly with X |
| r = +0.8 to +0.99 | Very strong positive | Very reliable relationship; strong predictive power |
| r = +0.6 to +0.79 | Strong positive | Substantial relationship; good for forecasting |
| r = +0.4 to +0.59 | Moderate positive | Noticeable but imperfect relationship |
| r = +0.2 to +0.39 | Weak positive | Slight relationship; limited predictive value |
| r = 0 to ±0.19 | Very weak/None | No meaningful linear relationship |
| r = -0.2 to -0.39 | Weak negative | Slight inverse relationship |
| r = -0.4 to -0.59 | Moderate negative | Noticeable inverse relationship |
| r = -0.6 to -0.79 | Strong negative | Substantial inverse relationship |
| r = -0.8 to -0.99 | Very strong negative | Very reliable inverse relationship |
| r = -1.0 | Perfect negative correlation | Perfect inverse predictability |

### Coefficient of Determination (r²)

**Definition:** The square of the correlation coefficient (r²) represents the **proportion of variance in Y that is explained by X**.

**Formula:**
$$r^2 = (\text{correlation coefficient})^2$$

**Interpretation:**
- Expressed as percentage: r² × 100%
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- Always positive, regardless of direction of correlation

**Example:**
- If r = 0.80, then r² = 0.64
- Interpretation: 64% of the variation in Y is explained by X
- Remaining 36% is due to other factors

---

### **Worked Example: Advertising Spend vs. Sales Revenue**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**BrightTech Solutions**, a software company, wants to determine if there is a relationship between their **monthly advertising expenditure** and **monthly sales revenue**. The marketing director has collected data for 8 months and wants to know:
1. Is there a correlation between advertising and sales?
2. How strong is this relationship?
3. What percentage of sales variation can be explained by advertising?

**Data Collected:**

| **Month** | **Advertising Spend (X)** | **Sales Revenue (Y)** |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
|           | (in $1,000s) | (in $10,000s) |
| 1 | 2 | 15 |
| 2 | 3 | 18 |
| 3 | 5 | 25 |
| 4 | 4 | 22 |
| 5 | 7 | 30 |
| 6 | 6 | 28 |
| 7 | 8 | 35 |
| 8 | 5 | 24 |

---

#### **Solution:**

**Step 1: Create a Scatter Diagram**

First, let's visualize the relationship:

```
Sales |
(Y)   |                        ●(35)
$100k |                   ●(30)
      |                 ●(28)
      |              ●(25)
      |           ●(24)
      |        ●(22)
      |     ●(18)
      |  ●(15)
      |_________________________
         2  3  4  5  6  7  8
         Advertising (X) $1000s

Pattern: Clear upward trend suggests positive correlation
```

**Step 2: Set Up Calculation Table**

We need to calculate: ΣX, ΣY, ΣX², ΣY², ΣXY

| **Month** | **X** | **Y** | **X²** | **Y²** | **XY** |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | 15 | 4 | 225 | 30 |
| 2 | 3 | 18 | 9 | 324 | 54 |
| 3 | 5 | 25 | 25 | 625 | 125 |
| 4 | 4 | 22 | 16 | 484 | 88 |
| 5 | 7 | 30 | 49 | 900 | 210 |
| 6 | 6 | 28 | 36 | 784 | 168 |
| 7 | 8 | 35 | 64 | 1,225 | 280 |
| 8 | 5 | 24 | 25 | 576 | 120 |
| **Totals** | **ΣX = 40** | **ΣY = 197** | **ΣX² = 228** | **ΣY² = 5,143** | **ΣXY = 1,075** |

**Given:**
- n = 8 (number of months)
- ΣX = 40
- ΣY = 197
- ΣX² = 228
- ΣY² = 5,143
- ΣXY = 1,075

---

**Step 3: Calculate Pearson's r**

**Formula:**

$$r = \frac{n\sum XY - \sum X \sum Y}{\sqrt{[n\sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2][n\sum Y^2 - (\sum Y)^2]}}$$

**Calculate the numerator:**

$$\text{Numerator} = n\sum XY - \sum X \sum Y$$

$$= 8(1,075) - (40)(197)$$

$$= 8,600 - 7,880$$

$$= 720$$

**Calculate the denominator (in parts):**

**Part 1:**
$$n\sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2 = 8(228) - (40)^2$$

$$= 1,824 - 1,600 = 224$$

**Part 2:**
$$n\sum Y^2 - (\sum Y)^2 = 8(5,143) - (197)^2$$

$$= 41,144 - 38,809 = 2,335$$

**Full Denominator:**
$$\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{224 \times 2,335}$$

$$= \sqrt{523,040}$$

$$= 723.07$$

**Calculate r:**

$$r = \frac{720}{723.07}$$

$$r = 0.9958$$

**Rounding:** r ≈ **0.996** or **+0.996**

---

**Step 4: Calculate Coefficient of Determination (r²)**

$$r^2 = (0.996)^2 = 0.992$$

**Percentage:** 0.992 × 100% = **99.2%**

---

**Step 5: Interpretation**

**Statistical Interpretation:**

1. **Correlation Coefficient (r = +0.996):**
   - Very strong positive correlation
   - Nearly perfect linear relationship
   - As advertising spend increases, sales revenue increases proportionally

2. **Coefficient of Determination (r² = 0.992):**
   - 99.2% of the variation in sales revenue is explained by advertising expenditure
   - Only 0.8% of sales variation is due to other factors
   - Excellent explanatory power

**Business Interpretation:**

1. **Key Finding:**
   - There is an extremely strong positive relationship between advertising expenditure and sales revenue
   - For this company, advertising is highly effective in driving sales

2. **Practical Implications:**
   - **Predictability:** Sales can be predicted very accurately from advertising spending
   - **ROI Confidence:** Investment in advertising reliably translates to increased sales
   - **Budget Justification:** Strong evidence to support advertising budget requests
   - **Planning:** Can use this relationship for sales forecasting and budget allocation

3. **Recommendations:**

   **A. Continue Advertising Investment:**
   - The correlation justifies continued or increased advertising spend
   - Each advertising dollar has a predictable impact on sales

   **B. Determine Optimal Budget:**
   - While correlation is strong, investigate if there's a saturation point
   - Calculate actual ROI (not just correlation) to find optimal spending level
   - Test if the relationship holds at higher spending levels

   **C. Further Analysis Needed:**
   - **Regression Analysis:** Develop equation to predict exact sales from advertising
   - **Causation Verification:** Conduct controlled experiments to confirm advertising causes sales
   - **Other Factors:** Investigate the remaining 0.8% of variance (seasonality, competition, economic conditions)

   **D. Strategic Planning:**
   - Use this model for quarterly and annual sales forecasting
   - Set realistic sales targets based on planned advertising budgets
   - Monitor if this relationship remains stable over time

4. **Important Caveats:**

   - **Not Causation:** While correlation is very strong, correlation doesn't prove causation
   - **Sample Size:** Only 8 months of data; should collect more for validation
   - **Extrapolation Risk:** Relationship may not hold outside observed range ($2,000-$8,000)
   - **Time Period:** Market conditions may change; regularly re-evaluate
   - **Confounding Variables:** Other factors (economy, competition, seasonality) may also influence sales

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Extend data collection to 12-24 months for more robust analysis
   - Perform regression analysis to create prediction equation
   - Conduct A/B testing to establish causation
   - Monitor correlation coefficient quarterly to detect changes
   - Investigate diminishing returns at higher advertising levels

## 3.6 Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient

### Introduction

**Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient** (denoted as **ρ** or **rₛ**) is a non-parametric measure of correlation that assesses the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables.

**Developed by:** Charles Spearman (1904)

**Key Difference from Pearson's r:**
- Pearson's r measures linear relationships between continuous variables
- Spearman's ρ measures monotonic relationships between ranked (ordinal) variables

### When to Use Spearman's Rank Correlation

**Use Spearman's ρ when:**

1. **Ordinal Data:** Variables are measured on ordinal scales (rankings)
2. **Non-Normal Distribution:** Data severely violates normality assumptions
3. **Outliers Present:** Extreme values that would distort Pearson's r
4. **Monotonic but Non-Linear:** Variables have a monotonic relationship that isn't linear
5. **Small Sample Sizes:** More robust than Pearson's r for small samples

**Don't use when:**
- Both variables are normally distributed continuous data (use Pearson's r)
- Relationship is clearly non-monotonic

### What is a Monotonic Relationship?

**Monotonic:** Variables consistently move in the same (or opposite) direction, but not necessarily at a constant rate.

**Examples:**
- **Monotonic increasing:** As X increases, Y always increases (but rate may vary)
- **Monotonic decreasing:** As X increases, Y always decreases (but rate may vary)

```
Linear (Pearson)     Monotonic (Spearman)
Y |    ●              Y |        ●
  |   ●                 |      ●
  |  ●                  |    ●
  | ●                   |  ●
  |●                    | ●
  |_________ X          |_________ X
  
Both show positive     Curved but consistently
correlation            increasing = monotonic
```

### Formula for Spearman's ρ

**When there are NO tied ranks:**

$$\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

**Where:**
- ρ (rho) = Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
- dᵢ = Difference between ranks of corresponding X and Y values
- n = Number of paired observations
- Σdᵢ² = Sum of squared differences

**When there ARE tied ranks:**

Use Pearson's formula on the ranks:

$$\rho = \frac{n\sum R_XR_Y - \sum R_X \sum R_Y}{\sqrt{[n\sum R_X^2 - (\sum R_X)^2][n\sum R_Y^2 - (\sum R_Y)^2]}}$$

Where R_X and R_Y are the ranks.

### Step-by-Step Procedure

**Step 1:** Rank the X values (1 = smallest, n = largest)
**Step 2:** Rank the Y values (1 = smallest, n = largest)
**Step 3:** Calculate differences (d) for each pair
**Step 4:** Square each difference (d²)
**Step 5:** Sum all squared differences (Σd²)
**Step 6:** Apply formula

### Handling Tied Ranks

When two or more observations have the same value, assign the **average rank**.

**Example:**
Values: 10, 15, 15, 20
Ranks: 1, 2.5, 2.5, 4 (positions 2 and 3 average to 2.5)

### Interpretation

**Range:** -1 ≤ ρ ≤ +1

**Same interpretation as Pearson's r:**
- ρ = +1: Perfect positive monotonic relationship
- ρ = -1: Perfect negative monotonic relationship
- ρ = 0: No monotonic relationship

### Business Example: Employee Ranking

**Scenario:** A company wants to determine if there's a relationship between **performance ratings** (subjective rankings by managers) and **years of experience**.

**Data:**

| **Employee** | **Years of Experience** | **Performance Rating** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| A | 5 | 7 |
| B | 2 | 4 |
| C | 8 | 9 |
| D | 3 | 5 |
| E | 10 | 10 |
| F | 1 | 3 |
| G | 6 | 8 |
| H | 4 | 6 |

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Rank Years of Experience (X)**

| **Employee** | **Experience** | **Rank (Rₓ)** |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| F | 1 | 1 |
| B | 2 | 2 |
| D | 3 | 3 |
| H | 4 | 4 |
| A | 5 | 5 |
| G | 6 | 6 |
| C | 8 | 7 |
| E | 10 | 8 |

**Step 2: Rank Performance Rating (Y)**

| **Employee** | **Rating** | **Rank (Rᵧ)** |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| F | 3 | 1 |
| B | 4 | 2 |
| D | 5 | 3 |
| H | 6 | 4 |
| A | 7 | 5 |
| G | 8 | 6 |
| C | 9 | 7 |
| E | 10 | 8 |

**Step 3: Calculate Differences and Squared Differences**

| **Employee** | **Rₓ** | **Rᵧ** | **d = Rₓ - Rᵧ** | **d²** |
|--------------|--------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| A | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| B | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| C | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| D | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| E | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| F | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| G | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| H | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | | | | **Σd² = 0** |

**Step 4: Calculate Spearman's ρ**

$$\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d^2}{n(n^2-1)}$$

$$\rho = 1 - \frac{6(0)}{8(64-1)}$$

$$\rho = 1 - \frac{0}{8(63)}$$

$$\rho = 1 - 0 = 1.0$$

**Interpretation:**
- ρ = +1.0 indicates perfect positive rank correlation
- Employees with more experience have proportionally higher performance ratings
- The ranking order is identical for both variables
- Strong evidence that experience relates to performance in this company

## 3.7 Comparison: Pearson vs. Spearman

| **Aspect** | **Pearson's r** | **Spearman's ρ** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Data Type** | Continuous (interval/ratio) | Ordinal (ranked) or continuous |
| **Relationship** | Linear | Monotonic (linear or non-linear) |
| **Distribution** | Assumes bivariate normality | No distribution assumptions |
| **Outliers** | Sensitive to outliers | Resistant to outliers |
| **Computation** | Based on actual values | Based on ranks |
| **Interpretation** | Measures linear association | Measures rank association |
| **When to Use** | Normal continuous data | Ranked data, outliers, non-linear monotonic |

## 3.8 Limitations and Assumptions

### Limitations of Correlation Analysis

**1. Correlation ≠ Causation**
- Cannot establish cause-and-effect
- Requires additional research methods

**2. Limited to Linear/Monotonic Relationships**
- May miss complex non-linear patterns
- Always visualize data first

**3. Sensitive to Outliers** (especially Pearson's r)
- Single extreme value can dramatically change r
- Check for and investigate outliers

**4. Influenced by Range Restriction**
- Limited range of X or Y can artificially reduce correlation
- Ensure adequate variability in both variables

**5. Spurious Correlations**
- Correlation may be due to confounding variables
- Consider alternative explanations

**6. Sample Size Dependency**
- Small samples may show high r by chance
- Larger samples needed for reliable estimates

### Assumptions for Pearson's r

**1. Linearity:** Relationship must be linear
**2. Bivariate Normality:** Both variables normally distributed
**3. Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance across range
**4. Independence:** Observations independent of each other
**5. Measurement Level:** Both variables continuous (interval/ratio)

### Assumptions for Spearman's ρ

**1. Monotonicity:** Relationship must be monotonic
**2. Ordinal or Higher:** At least ordinal level of measurement
**3. Independence:** Observations independent
**4. Fewer Restrictions:** More robust, fewer assumptions than Pearson's

## Summary of Chapter 3

**1. Correlation** measures the strength and direction of relationships between variables, but does **not** imply causation.

**2. Types of correlation:**
- **Positive:** Variables move together
- **Negative:** Variables move in opposite directions
- **Zero:** No linear relationship

**3. Scatter diagrams** are essential for visualizing relationships before calculating correlation coefficients.

**4. Pearson's r:**
- Measures linear correlation
- Range: -1 to +1
- r² indicates proportion of variance explained

**5. Spearman's ρ:**
- Measures rank correlation
- More robust to outliers
- Appropriate for ordinal data or non-linear monotonic relationships

**6. Always consider:**
- Business context
- Potential confounding variables
- Whether correlation makes practical sense
- Need for additional causal analysis

## Practice Questions

**1. Conceptual:**
Explain why a strong correlation between umbrella sales and ice cream sales doesn't mean one causes the other. Identify a potential confounding variable.

**2. Calculation (Pearson's r):**
Calculate the correlation coefficient for the following data on training hours and productivity:

| Training Hours (X) | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| Productivity (Y) | 40 | 50 | 55 | 65 | 70 |

**3. Interpretation:**
If r = -0.75 between price and demand, interpret this value in business terms. Calculate r² and explain its meaning.

**4. Spearman's Rank:**
Five products are ranked by quality (1-5) and customer satisfaction (1-5). Calculate Spearman's ρ:

| Product | Quality Rank | Satisfaction Rank |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| A | 1 | 2 |
| B | 2 | 1 |
| C | 3 | 3 |
| D | 4 | 5 |
| E | 5 | 4 |

**5. Application:**
A retailer finds r = 0.95 between store size (sq ft) and monthly revenue. The manager concludes that expanding all stores will proportionally increase revenue. Critique this conclusion.
