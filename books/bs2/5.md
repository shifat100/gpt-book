## 5.3 Components of Time Series

A time series typically consists of four distinct components that, when combined, explain the overall pattern of the data.

### Classical Decomposition Model

**Multiplicative Model (Most Common):**
$$Y = T \times S \times C \times I$$

**Additive Model:**
$$Y = T + S + C + I$$

**Where:**
- **Y** = Actual observed value
- **T** = Trend component
- **S** = Seasonal component
- **C** = Cyclical component
- **I** = Irregular component

**When to use each:**
- **Multiplicative:** When seasonal variations increase/decrease proportionally with trend level (most business data)
- **Additive:** When seasonal variations remain constant regardless of trend level

---

### Component 1: Trend (T)

**Definition:** The long-term general direction in which data moves over an extended period. It represents the underlying growth or decline pattern.

**Characteristics:**
- Long-term movement (upward, downward, or stable)
- Smooth, continuous change
- Usually spans multiple years
- Represents fundamental forces affecting the series

**Types of Trends:**

**1. Linear Trend:**
- Constant rate of increase/decrease
- Forms a straight line
- Example: Population growth in stable conditions

**2. Non-Linear Trend:**
- Changing rate of growth/decline
- Forms a curve
- Subtypes:
  - **Exponential:** Accelerating growth (e.g., technology adoption)
  - **Logarithmic:** Decelerating growth (e.g., market saturation)
  - **Polynomial:** Multiple inflection points

**3. No Trend:**
- Data fluctuates around a constant mean
- Stationary series

**Business Examples:**

**Upward Trend:**
```
Sales |              ●
      |           ●
      |        ●     ← Long-term upward trend
      |     ●
      |  ●
      |___________________
          Time (Years)

Examples:

- Pattern completes within one year
- Predictable and consistent
- Same time period each cycle

**Common Seasonal Periods:**
- **Quarterly:** Every 3 months (4 seasons per year)
- **Monthly:** Every 30 days (12 months per year)
- **Weekly:** Every 7 days (52 weeks per year)
- **Daily:** Every 24 hours (within a week pattern)

**Visual Representation:**
```
Sales |  ●        ●        ●
      | /|       /|       /|      ← Peaks repeat
      |/ |      / |      / |         every year
      |  |     /  |     /  |
      |  |    /   |    /   |      ← Valleys repeat
      |  | ● /    | ● /    | ●      every year

- **Business Practices:** Fiscal year-end, quarterly reporting
- **Biological Cycles:** Agricultural seasons

**Measuring Seasonal Effect:**
- Seasonal Index (SI)
- Ratio-to-Moving Average Method
- SI > 1.0 = Above average (peak season)
- SI = 1.0 = Average
- SI < 1.0 = Below average (off-season)

---

### Component 3: Cyclical (C)

**Definition:** Long-term wavelike fluctuations around the trend that last more than one year. These are oscillations that don't have a fixed period.

**Characteristics:**
- Duration longer than one year (typically 2-10 years)
- Irregular in length and magnitude
- Not predictable like seasonal patterns
- Related to economic business cycles

**Difference from Seasonal:**
| **Seasonal** | **Cyclical** |
|--------------|--------------|
| Fixed period (≤1 year) | Variable period (>1 year) |
| Predictable timing | Irregular timing |
| Regular pattern | Varying amplitude |
| Same cause each cycle | Different causes |

**Visual Representation:**
```

## 5.4 Methods of Trend Analysis

Identifying and projecting the trend component is fundamental to time series forecasting. We'll examine several methods, from simple visual techniques to sophisticated mathematical approaches.

### Method 1: Freehand (Graphic) Method

**Description:** The simplest method where a trend line is drawn by eye through data points plotted on a graph.

**Procedure:**

**Step 1:** Plot the time series data on a graph
- X-axis: Time periods
- Y-axis: Variable values

**Step 2:** Visually examine the pattern

**Step 3:** Draw a smooth line that appears to best represent the general direction
- Try to balance points above and below the line
- Line should capture overall movement
- Ignore short-term fluctuations

**Visual Example:**
```
Sales |              ●
      |           ●     ●
      |        ●           ← Freehand trend line
      |     ●        ●  /    drawn through middle
      |  ●      ●   /       of data points
      |     ●    /
      |___●___/_____________
          Time (Years)
```

**Advantages:**
- Quick and easy
- No calculations required
- Good for preliminary analysis
- Intuitive understanding

**Disadvantages:**
- Subjective (different people draw different lines)
- Not reproducible
- No mathematical precision
- Cannot calculate forecast accuracy
- Not suitable for formal forecasting

**Business Use:**
- Initial data exploration
- Quick visual assessment
- Presentations to non-technical audiences
- Supplementary to quantitative methods

---

### Method 2: Moving Average Method

**Description:** A technique that smooths short-term fluctuations to reveal the underlying trend by calculating averages of successive groups of data points.

**Concept:** Each data point is replaced by the average of itself and surrounding observations, creating a smoother series that highlights the trend.

**Types of Moving Averages:**

#### **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**

**Formula for n-period moving average:**
$$MA_t = \frac{Y_{t-n+1} + Y_{t-n+2} + ... + Y_t}{n}$$

**Where:**
- MA_t = Moving average at time t
- Y = Observed values
- n = Number of periods in the moving average

**Common Periods:**
- **3-period MA:** Good for quarterly data, minimal smoothing
- **5-period MA:** Moderate smoothing
- **7-period or higher:** Strong smoothing, removes more fluctuation

#### **Choosing the Period (n):**

**Small n (e.g., 3):**
- Less smoothing
- More responsive to changes
- Retains more fluctuation
- Better for short-term trends

**Large n (e.g., 7, 12):**
- More smoothing
- Less responsive to changes
- Removes more fluctuation
- Better for long-term trends

**Odd vs. Even Period:**
- **Odd n (3, 5, 7):** Centered naturally, easier to interpret
- **Even n (4, 12):** Requires additional centering calculation

---

### **Worked Example: 3-Period Moving Average**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**TechGadget Inc.** wants to identify the trend in their quarterly sales data to make better inventory decisions. They've collected sales data for the past 12 quarters.

**Data:**

| **Quarter** | **Year** | **Sales ($000s)** |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Q1 | 2021 | 120 |
| Q2 | 2021 | 135 |
| Q3 | 2021 | 150 |
| Q4 | 2021 | 145 |
| Q1 | 2022 | 160 |
| Q2 | 2022 | 175 |
| Q3 | 2022 | 190 |
| Q4 | 2022 | 185 |
| Q1 | 2023 | 200 |
| Q2 | 2023 | 215 |
| Q3 | 2023 | 230 |
| Q4 | 2023 | 225 |

---

#### **Solution:**

**Calculate 3-Period Moving Average:**

| **Quarter** | **Sales (Y)** | **3-Period MA** | **Calculation** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Q1 2021 | 120 | - | Not enough data |
| Q2 2021 | 135 | - | Not enough data |
| Q3 2021 | 150 | 135.0 | (120+135+150)/3 |
| Q4 2021 | 145 | 143.3 | (135+150+145)/3 |
| Q1 2022 | 160 | 151.7 | (150+145+160)/3 |
| Q2 2022 | 175 | 160.0 | (145+160+175)/3 |
| Q3 2022 | 190 | 175.0 | (160+175+190)/3 |
| Q4 2022 | 185 | 183.3 | (175+190+185)/3 |
| Q1 2023 | 200 | 191.7 | (190+185+200)/3 |
| Q2 2023 | 215 | 200.0 | (185+200+215)/3 |
| Q3 2023 | 230 | 215.0 | (200+215+230)/3 |
| Q4 2023 | 225 | 223.3 | (215+230+225)/3 |

**Detailed Calculation Example (Q3 2021):**
$$MA = \frac{120 + 135 + 150}{3} = \frac{405}{3} = 135.0$$

- Different n gives different results
- May require experimentation

**5. Equal Weights:**
- All observations weighted equally
- Recent data not emphasized
- May not reflect current conditions

---

### Method 3: Method of Least Squares (Linear Trend)

**Description:** The most rigorous and widely-used method for fitting a trend line. It uses regression analysis to find the mathematically "best-fitting" straight line through the data.

**Concept:** Find the line that minimizes the sum of squared vertical deviations between actual values and the trend line (same principle as regression in Chapter 4).

**Linear Trend Equation:**
$$Y_t = a + bt$$

**Where:**
- $Y_t$ = Trend value at time t
- t = Time period (coded: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
- a = Y-intercept (trend value at t = 0)
- b = Slope (rate of change per time period)

**Formulas:**

**Slope (b):**
$$b = \frac{n\sum tY - \sum t \sum Y}{n\sum t^2 - (\sum t)^2}$$

**Intercept (a):**
$$a = \frac{\sum Y}{n} - b\frac{\sum t}{n} = \bar{Y} - b\bar{t}$$

**Simplified when t is coded symmetrically:** (Σt = 0)
$$b = \frac{\sum tY}{\sum t^2}$$
$$a = \frac{\sum Y}{n} = \bar{Y}$$

### **Worked Example: Annual Sales Trend Using Least Squares**

#### **Business Scenario:**

**Global Manufacturing Corp.** wants to forecast future sales based on historical performance. The financial planning team has collected annual sales data for the past 10 years and needs to:
1. Determine the trend equation
2. Understand the annual growth rate
3. Forecast sales for the next 2 years
4. Use this for budget planning

**Data Collected:**

| **Year** | **Sales ($Million)** |
|----------|---------------------|
| 2014 | 45 |
| 2015 | 52 |
| 2016 | 58 |
| 2017 | 63 |
| 2018 | 70 |
| 2019 | 75 |
| 2020 | 79 |
| 2021 | 85 |
| 2022 | 92 |
| 2023 | 98 |

---

#### **Solution:**

**Step 1: Code the Time Variable**

To simplify calculations, we code years symmetrically around zero. With 10 years (even number), we use: -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, +1, +3, +5, +7, +9

**Why this coding?**
- Makes Σt = 0
- Simplifies formulas
- Reduces rounding errors
- Makes calculations easier

| **Year** | **Sales (Y)** | **Time Code (t)** |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2014 | 45 | -9 |
| 2015 | 52 | -7 |
| 2016 | 58 | -5 |
| 2017 | 63 | -3 |
| 2018 | 70 | -1 |
| 2019 | 75 | +1 |
| 2020 | 79 | +3 |
| 2021 | 85 | +5 |
| 2022 | 92 | +7 |
| 2023 | 98 | +9 |

---

**Step 2: Create Calculation Table**

| **Year** | **Sales (Y)** | **t** | **t²** | **tY** |

| 2014 | 45 | -9 | 81 | -405 |
| 2015 | 52 | -7 | 49 | -364 |
| 2016 | 58 | -5 | 25 | -290 |
| 2017 | 63 | -3 | 9 | -189 |

| 2020 | 79 | 3 | 9 | 237 |
| 2021 | 85 | 5 | 25 | 425 |
| 2022 | 92 | 7 | 49 | 644 |
| 2023 | 98 | 9 | 81 | 882 |
| **Totals** | **ΣY = 717** | **Σt = 0** | **Σt² = 330** | **ΣtY = 945** |

**Summary Statistics:**
- n = 10
- ΣY = 717
- Σt = 0 ✓ (confirms proper coding)
- Σt² = 330
- ΣtY = 945

---

**Step 3: Calculate the Slope (b)**

Since Σt = 0, we use the simplified formula:

$$b = \frac{\sum tY}{\sum t^2} = \frac{945}{330} = 2.864$$

**Rounded:** b = 2.86

**Interpretation:** Sales increase by $2.86 million per year on average

---

**Step 4: Calculate the Intercept (a)**

Since Σt = 0:

$$a = \frac{\sum Y}{n} = \frac{717}{10} = 71.7$$

**Interpretation:** The trend value at the middle of the time period (between 2018 and 2019) is $71.7 million

---

**Step 5: Write the Trend Equation**

$$Y_t = 71.7 + 2.86t$$

**Where:**
- $Y_t$ = Trend value (predicted sales in $ millions)
- t = Time code (-9, -7, ..., +7, +9)
- This equation is valid for the coded time values

**To use calendar years, we can express as:**
$$Y_t = 71.7 + 2.86 \times (Year - 2018.5)$$

---

**Step 6: Calculate Trend Values**

Let's verify our equation by calculating trend values for each year:

| **Year** | **Actual Sales (Y)** | **t** | **Trend ($Y_t$)** | **Calculation** |
|----------|---------------------|-------|------------------|----------------|
| 2014 | 45 | -9 | 45.96 | 71.7 + 2.86(-9) |
| 2015 | 52 | -7 | 51.68 | 71.7 + 2.86(-7) |
| 2016 | 58 | -5 | 57.40 | 71.7 + 2.86(-5) |
| 2017 | 63 | -3 | 63.12 | 71.7 + 2.86(-3) |
| 2018 | 70 | -1 | 68.84 | 71.7 + 2.86(-1) |
| 2019 | 75 | 1 | 74.56 | 71.7 + 2.86(1) |
| 2020 | 79 | 3 | 80.28 | 71.7 + 2.86(3) |
| 2021 | 85 | 5 | 86.00 | 71.7 + 2.86(5) |
| 2022 | 92 | 7 | 91.72 | 71.7 + 2.86(7) |
| 2023 | 98 | 9 | 97.44 | 71.7 + 2.86(9) |

**Example Calculation (2014):**
$$Y_t = 71.7 + 2.86(-9) = 71.7 - 25.74 = 45.96$$

---

**Step 7: Make Forecasts**

**For 2024 (t = 11):**
$$Y_{2024} = 71.7 + 2.86(11) = 71.7 + 31.46 = 103.16$$

**Forecast: $103.16 million**

**For 2025 (t = 13):**
$$Y_{2025} = 71.7 + 2.86(13) = 71.7 + 37.18 = 108.88$$

**Forecast: $108.88 million**

**For 2026 (t = 15):**
$$Y_{2026} = 71.7 + 2.86(15) = 71.7 + 42.90 = 114.60$$

**Forecast: $114.60 million**

## 5.5 Measuring Seasonal Variations

### Introduction to Seasonal Analysis

**Seasonal variations** represent predictable, recurring patterns within a year. Measuring these variations helps businesses:
- Plan for peak and off-peak periods
- Manage inventory effectively
- Schedule workforce appropriately
- Set realistic monthly/quarterly targets
- Understand true business performance

### The Seasonal Index

**Seasonal Index (SI)** is a number that indicates how a particular season compares to the average.

**Interpretation:**
- **SI = 1.00 (or 100):** Average season
- **SI > 1.00 (or >100):** Above average (peak season)
- **SI < 1.00 (or <100):** Below average (off-season)

**Example:**
- December SI = 1.50 means sales are 50% above average
- February SI = 0.70 means sales are 30% below average

### Methods of Measuring Seasonal Variation

#### **1. Ratio-to-Moving Average Method**

**Most common and reliable method for calculating seasonal indices.**

**Procedure:**

**Step 1:** Calculate moving average (removes seasonal and irregular components)

**Step 2:** Calculate ratio of actual to moving average:
$$\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Actual Value}}{\text{Moving Average}} \times 100$$

**Step 3:** Average ratios for each season across all years

**Step 4:** Adjust so average SI = 1.00 (or 100)

---

**Step 5:** Apply seasonal indices for deseasonalization and forecasting

**Brief Example (Quarterly Data):**

| **Quarter** | **Actual Sales** | **Moving Avg** | **Ratio (%)** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Q1 2022 | 80 | 95 | 84.2 |
| Q2 2022 | 110 | 97 | 113.4 |
| Q3 2022 | 95 | 99 | 96.0 |
| Q4 2022 | 105 | 101 | 104.0 |

After collecting multiple years and averaging:

| **Quarter** | **Average Seasonal Index** |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Q1 | 0.85 (15% below average) |
| Q2 | 1.12 (12% above average) |
| Q3 | 0.97 (3% below average) |
| Q4 | 1.06 (6% above average) |

**Total:** 4.00 (averages to 1.00) ✓

---

#### **2. Percentage of Trend Method**

**Simpler method that compares actual values to trend values.**

**Procedure:**

**Step 1:** Calculate trend values using least squares

**Step 2:** Calculate percentage of trend:
$$\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Actual Value}}{\text{Trend Value}} \times 100$$

**Step 3:** Average percentages for each season

**Step 4:** Adjust to ensure average = 100

---

#### **3. Simple Average Method**

**Quickest but least accurate method.**

**Procedure:**

**Step 1:** Calculate average for each season across all years

**Step 2:** Calculate overall average

**Step 3:** Express each seasonal average as percentage of overall average

**Best used when:**
- Quick estimate needed
- Limited data available
- Trend is minimal

---

### Applications of Seasonal Indices

#### **1. Deseasonalization**

**Purpose:** Remove seasonal effects to see underlying trend

**Formula:**
$$\text{Deseasonalized Value} = \frac{\text{Actual Value}}{\text{Seasonal Index}}$$

**Example:**
- Actual December sales: $150,000
- December SI: 1.50
- Deseasonalized: $150,000 / 1.50 = $100,000

**Interpretation:** After removing the typical December boost, sales are equivalent to $100,000 in an average month.

**Business Use:**
- Compare performance across seasons fairly
- Evaluate if growth is real or just seasonal
- Assess effectiveness of non-seasonal strategies

---

#### **2. Seasonally Adjusted Forecasting**

**Purpose:** Create realistic monthly/quarterly forecasts

**Step 1:** Forecast trend value (using least squares)

**Step 2:** Apply seasonal index:
$$\text{Forecast} = \text{Trend Forecast} \times \text{Seasonal Index}$$

**Example:**
- Trend forecast for December 2024: $200,000
- December SI: 1.50
- Adjusted forecast: $200,000 × 1.50 = $300,000

---

#### **3. Inventory Planning**

**Use seasonal indices to:**
- Stock more inventory before peak seasons
- Reduce inventory during off-seasons
- Avoid stockouts and overstock situations
- Optimize cash flow

**Example Planning:**

| **Month** | **SI** | **Base Stock** | **Adjusted Stock** |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| November | 1.30 | 10,000 units | 13,000 units |
| December | 1.50 | 10,000 units | 15,000 units |
| January | 0.70 | 10,000 units | 7,000 units |

---

#### **4. Workforce Scheduling**

**Adjust staffing levels based on seasonal demand:**
- Hire temporary workers for peak seasons
- Reduce hours during slow periods
- Plan employee vacations during off-seasons
- Optimize labor costs

---

#### **5. Performance Evaluation**

**Compare actual performance to seasonally adjusted targets:**
- Don't blame managers for seasonal downturns
- Don't over-praise for seasonal upswings
- Evaluate based on deseasonalized metrics
- Set realistic monthly/quarterly goals

**Example:**

**Traditional Evaluation (Wrong):**
- February sales: $70,000 (below $100,000 target) → Manager criticized

**Seasonally Adjusted Evaluation (Right):**
- February SI: 0.70
- Adjusted target: $100,000 × 0.70 = $70,000
- Actual: $70,000 → Manager met adjusted target ✓

### Business Example: Retail Seasonal Pattern

**Typical Seasonal Indices for Retail:**

| **Month** | **Seasonal Index** | **Interpretation** |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| January | 0.75 | Post-holiday slump |
| February | 0.70 | Lowest sales month |
| March | 0.85 | Recovery begins |
| April | 0.95 | Near average |
| May | 1.00 | Average |
| June | 1.05 | Slightly above average |
| July | 0.90 | Summer slowdown |
| August | 1.10 | Back-to-school boost |
| September | 1.00 | Average |
| October | 1.05 | Holiday prep begins |
| November | 1.30 | Black Friday boost |
| December | 1.50 | Holiday peak |
| **Average** | **1.01** | **(adjusted to 1.00)** |

**Strategic Implications:**
- Prepare for 50% sales increase in December
- Plan for 30% decrease in February
- Don't expect even monthly performance
- Budget and plan with seasonal reality in mind
