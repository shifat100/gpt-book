# Chapter 7: Index Numbers

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of business and economics, understanding how prices, quantities, and values change over time is crucial for decision-making. A marketing manager needs to know whether sales have genuinely increased or merely kept pace with inflation. An economist must assess whether purchasing power has increased or decreased. A business analyst needs to compare economic conditions across different time periods.

**Index Numbers** are powerful statistical tools that help us measure and compare changes in complex economic and business variables over time. They transform complicated data into simple, easy-to-understand numbers that facilitate comparison and analysis.

---

## 7.1 Definition and Concept of Index Numbers

### What is an Index Number?

An **Index Number** is a statistical measure that shows the relative change in a variable (or group of variables) with respect to a base period. It expresses the value of a variable in one period as a percentage of its value in another period, called the base period.

**Simple Definition:** An index number is a percentage ratio that measures the change in a variable from one time period (base period) to another time period (current period).

**Formula (Basic Concept):**

**Index Number = (Current Period Value / Base Period Value) × 100**

### Key Terminology

**1. Base Period (Reference Period):**
- The period against which comparisons are made
- Usually assigned an index value of 100
- Example: If 2020 is the base year, its index = 100

**2. Current Period (Given Period):**
- The period being compared to the base period
- Its index value shows the relative change

**3. Relatives:**
- Individual index numbers for specific items
- Price relative = (P₁/P₀) × 100
- Quantity relative = (Q₁/Q₀) × 100

### Characteristics of Index Numbers

**1. Expressed as Percentages:**
- Index numbers are pure numbers without units
- They are typically expressed with the base = 100
- An index of 125 means a 25% increase from the base period

**2. Specialized Averages:**
- Index numbers are specialized forms of averages
- They average the relative changes in different items
- Different methods of averaging create different types of indices

**3. Measure Relative Changes:**
- Show changes relative to a base period, not absolute values
- Cannot compare absolute magnitudes directly
- Example: Index 150 doesn't mean the price is $150

**4. Universal Application:**
- Can be constructed for prices, quantities, production, sales, etc.
- Used in economics, business, finance, and social sciences

**5. Facilitate Comparisons:**
- Enable comparison across time periods
- Allow comparison of items measured in different units
- Simplify complex data into understandable figures

### Uses of Index Numbers in Business and Economics

**1. Economic Policy Formulation:**
- Government uses price indices to formulate monetary and fiscal policies
- Help in assessing inflation and economic growth
- Guide decisions on interest rates and taxation

**2. Wage and Salary Adjustments:**
- Cost of Living Index determines wage increases
- Ensures wages keep pace with inflation
- Used in collective bargaining negotiations

**3. Deflating Money Values:**
- Convert nominal values to real values
- Remove the effect of price changes from value data
- **Real Value = Nominal Value / Price Index × 100**

**4. Business Forecasting and Planning:**
- Predict future trends based on historical indices
- Plan production schedules based on demand indices
- Forecast sales and revenue

**5. Performance Evaluation:**
- Compare company performance over time
- Benchmark against industry indices
- Measure productivity changes

**6. International Comparisons:**
- Compare economic conditions across countries
- Assess purchasing power parity
- Evaluate trade competitiveness

**7. Investment Decisions:**
- Stock market indices guide investment choices
- Track portfolio performance
- Assess market trends

### Types of Index Numbers

Index numbers can be classified based on different criteria:

**Based on Variables Covered:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Price Index** | Measures changes in price levels | Consumer Price Index (CPI) |
| **Quantity Index** | Measures changes in physical quantities | Industrial Production Index |
| **Value Index** | Measures changes in monetary values | GDP Index |

**Based on Number of Variables:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple Index** | Measures change in a single item | Price index of wheat |
| **Composite Index** | Measures change in a group of items | Wholesale Price Index |

**Based on Weighting:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unweighted Index** | All items treated equally |
| **Weighted Index** | Items weighted by importance |

---

## 7.2 Methods of Constructing Index Numbers

### 7.2.1 Unweighted Index Numbers

Unweighted indices treat all items as equally important. These are simple to calculate but ignore the reality that some items are more significant than others in business and economic contexts.

#### Simple Aggregative Method

This is the simplest method of constructing an index number. It involves summing the prices (or quantities) of all items in the current year and comparing with the sum in the base year.

**Formula for Price Index:**

**P₀₁ = (ΣP₁ / ΣP₀) × 100**

Where:
- P₀₁ = Price index for year 1 with base year 0
- P₁ = Price in the current year
- P₀ = Price in the base year
- Σ = Summation symbol

**Advantages:**
- Very simple to understand and calculate
- Requires minimal data
- Quick for preliminary analysis

**Disadvantages:**
- Ignores the relative importance of items
- Influenced by the units of measurement
- Not suitable when items differ greatly in importance

**Example: Simple Aggregative Price Index**

A business analyst wants to track price changes for office supplies from 2023 (base year) to 2024.

| Item | Price 2023 (P₀) - Taka | Price 2024 (P₁) - Taka |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Paper (ream) | 250 | 275 |
| Pens (box) | 120 | 135 |
| Folders (pack) | 80 | 85 |
| Stapler | 150 | 165 |

**Calculation:**

ΣP₀ = 250 + 120 + 80 + 150 = **600**

ΣP₁ = 275 + 135 + 85 + 165 = **660**

**P₀₁ = (660 / 600) × 100 = 110**

**Interpretation:** Office supply prices increased by 10% from 2023 to 2024.

---

### 7.2.2 Weighted Index Numbers

Weighted indices assign different levels of importance (weights) to different items based on their relative significance. This provides a more realistic measure of change.

The most common weighted indices are:
1. Laspeyres' Index
2. Paasche's Index
3. Fisher's Ideal Index

#### A. Laspeyres' Price Index

**Laspeyres' Index** uses **base year quantities** as weights. It measures how much the base year basket of goods would cost at current prices.

**Formula:**

**P₀₁(L) = (ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100**

Where:
- P₁ = Current year price
- P₀ = Base year price
- Q₀ = Base year quantity (weights)

**Characteristics:**
- Uses fixed base year quantities
- Easier to calculate as weights don't change
- Tends to overstate inflation (upward bias)
- Most commonly used in practice (e.g., CPI uses this method)

**Upward Bias Explanation:** Consumers tend to substitute expensive items with cheaper alternatives. Since Laspeyres uses fixed base year quantities, it doesn't account for this substitution effect.

#### B. Paasche's Price Index

**Paasche's Index** uses **current year quantities** as weights. It measures how much the current year basket would have cost at base year prices.

**Formula:**

**P₀₁(P) = (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₁) × 100**

Where:
- P₁ = Current year price
- P₀ = Base year price
- Q₁ = Current year quantity (weights)

**Characteristics:**
- Uses current year quantities as weights
- Requires new quantity data each period
- Tends to understate inflation (downward bias)
- More difficult to calculate

**Downward Bias Explanation:** Since quantities adjust to price changes, consumers buy less of items that become expensive. This makes the current basket cheaper relative to what the base basket would cost.

#### C. Fisher's Ideal Index

**Fisher's Ideal Index** is the geometric mean of Laspeyres' and Paasche's indices. It attempts to split the difference between the two methods and eliminate their biases.

**Formula:**

**P₀₁(F) = √[P₀₁(L) × P₀₁(P)]**

Or equivalently:

**P₀₁(F) = √[(ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₁)] × 100**

**Characteristics:**
- Combines both Laspeyres and Paasche
- Satisfies both Time Reversal and Factor Reversal tests (discussed later)
- Considered theoretically superior
- More complex to calculate
- Provides a balanced measure

## 7.3 Comprehensive Worked Example: Weighted Index Numbers

### Business Scenario: Retail Store Price Analysis

**Problem Statement:**

A retail chain wants to analyze price changes for essential grocery items between 2023 (base year) and 2024 (current year). The management needs to calculate:
1. Laspeyres' Price Index
2. Paasche's Price Index
3. Fisher's Ideal Price Index

This will help them understand inflation trends and make pricing decisions.

### Data Table

| Item | Base Year (2023) | Current Year (2024) |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
|  | Price (P₀) - Taka | Quantity (Q₀) - Units | Price (P₁) - Taka | Quantity (Q₁) - Units |
| Rice (kg) | 60 | 500 | 68 | 520 |
| Lentils (kg) | 120 | 200 | 135 | 180 |
| Cooking Oil (liter) | 180 | 150 | 200 | 140 |
| Sugar (kg) | 70 | 300 | 80 | 280 |

---

### Solution

#### Step 1: Create Calculation Table

We need to calculate four components:
- P₀Q₀ (Base year value)
- P₁Q₀ (Current year prices × Base year quantities)
- P₀Q₁ (Base year prices × Current year quantities)
- P₁Q₁ (Current year value)

| Item | P₀ | Q₀ | P₁ | Q₁ | P₀Q₀ | P₁Q₀ | P₀Q₁ | P₁Q₁ |
|------|----|----|----|----|------|------|------|------|
| Rice | 60 | 500 | 68 | 520 | 30,000 | 34,000 | 31,200 | 35,360 |
| Lentils | 120 | 200 | 135 | 180 | 24,000 | 27,000 | 21,600 | 24,300 |
| Cooking Oil | 180 | 150 | 200 | 140 | 27,000 | 30,000 | 25,200 | 28,000 |
| Sugar | 70 | 300 | 80 | 280 | 21,000 | 24,000 | 19,600 | 22,400 |
| **Total** | | | | | **102,000** | **115,000** | **97,600** | **110,060** |

**Detailed Calculations:**

**For Rice:**
- P₀Q₀ = 60 × 500 = 30,000
- P₁Q₀ = 68 × 500 = 34,000
- P₀Q₁ = 60 × 520 = 31,200
- P₁Q₁ = 68 × 520 = 35,360

**For Lentils:**
- P₀Q₀ = 120 × 200 = 24,000
- P₁Q₀ = 135 × 200 = 27,000
- P₀Q₁ = 120 × 180 = 21,600
- P₁Q₁ = 135 × 180 = 24,300

**For Cooking Oil:**
- P₀Q₀ = 180 × 150 = 27,000
- P₁Q₀ = 200 × 150 = 30,000
- P₀Q₁ = 180 × 140 = 25,200
- P₁Q₁ = 200 × 140 = 28,000

**For Sugar:**
- P₀Q₀ = 70 × 300 = 21,000
- P₁Q₀ = 80 × 300 = 24,000
- P₀Q₁ = 70 × 280 = 19,600
- P₁Q₁ = 80 × 280 = 22,400

---

#### Step 2: Calculate Laspeyres' Price Index

**Formula:** P₀₁(L) = (ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100

**P₀₁(L) = (115,000 / 102,000) × 100**

**P₀₁(L) = 1.1275 × 100**

**P₀₁(L) = 112.75**

**Interpretation:** According to Laspeyres' method, if the retail chain had purchased the same quantities of items as in 2023 (base year) at 2024 prices, it would cost 112.75% of what it cost in 2023. This represents a **12.75% increase** in prices.

---

#### Step 3: Calculate Paasche's Price Index

**Formula:** P₀₁(P) = (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₁) × 100

**P₀₁(P) = (110,060 / 97,600) × 100**

**P₀₁(P) = 1.1277 × 100**

**P₀₁(P) = 112.77**

**Interpretation:** According to Paasche's method, the 2024 basket of goods costs 112.77% of what the same basket would have cost at 2023 prices. This also represents approximately a **12.77% increase** in prices.

---

#### Step 4: Calculate Fisher's Ideal Price Index

**Formula:** P₀₁(F) = √[P₀₁(L) × P₀₁(P)]

**P₀₁(F) = √[112.75 × 112.77]**

**P₀₁(F) = √12,717.5775**

**P₀₁(F) = 112.76**

**Interpretation:** Fisher's Ideal Index, which balances both Laspeyres and Paasche methods, indicates that grocery prices increased by **12.76%** from 2023 to 2024.

---

### Step 5: Summary of Results

| Index Type | Value | Price Increase |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| **Laspeyres' Index** | 112.75 | 12.75% |
| **Paasche's Index** | 112.77 | 12.77% |
| **Fisher's Ideal Index** | 112.76 | 12.76% |

**Business Insights:**

1. **Price Inflation:** All three indices show approximately 12.76% inflation in essential grocery items over one year.

2. **Consistency:** The close agreement between Laspeyres and Paasche (only 0.02 difference) suggests stable consumption patterns with minimal substitution effects.

3. **Management Decisions:**
   - Consider adjusting retail prices to maintain profit margins
   - Negotiate with suppliers for better rates
   - Explore alternative suppliers for high-inflation items
   - Communicate price changes to customers with proper justification

4. **Consumer Impact:** A household spending 10,000 Taka monthly on these items in 2023 would need approximately 11,276 Taka in 2024 to purchase the same basket.

## 7.4 Tests of Adequacy of Index Numbers

Index numbers must satisfy certain logical tests to be considered reliable and adequate. Two important tests are:

### 7.4.1 Time Reversal Test

**Concept:**

The Time Reversal Test checks whether an index number works consistently when the base year and current year are interchanged. If we calculate an index forward in time and then backward, we should return to the starting point (100).

**Mathematical Condition:**

**P₀₁ × P₁₀ = 1** (or **100 when expressed as percentages**)

Where:
- P₀₁ = Index from base year 0 to current year 1
- P₁₀ = Index from year 1 to year 0 (reversed)

**Interpretation:** If you calculate the index from 2020 to 2024 and get 125, then calculating from 2024 back to 2020 should give you 80 (because 125 × 0.80 = 100).

**Which Indices Pass This Test?**

| Index Type | Time Reversal Test | Result |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Simple Aggregative** | ✓ | Passes |
| **Laspeyres' Index** | ✗ | Fails |
| **Paasche's Index** | ✗ | Fails |
| **Fisher's Ideal Index** | ✓ | Passes |

**Why Laspeyres and Paasche Fail:**

When we reverse the time periods:
- Laspeyres uses Q₀ in the forward index and Q₁ in the backward index
- Paasche uses Q₁ in the forward index and Q₀ in the backward index
- The weights change, causing inconsistency

**Example Demonstration:**

Using our previous grocery data:

**Forward (2023 to 2024):**
- Laspeyres = 112.75

**Backward (2024 to 2023):**
We would calculate using 2024 as base:
- P₁₀(L) = (ΣP₀Q₁ / ΣP₁Q₁) × 100 = (97,600 / 110,060) × 100 = 88.69

**Test:** 112.75 × 88.69 ÷ 100 = 99.99 ≈ 100 (approximately, but not exactly)

The slight discrepancy shows Laspeyres doesn't perfectly satisfy the test, though it's close in this case.

---

### 7.4.2 Factor Reversal Test

**Concept:**

The Factor Reversal Test checks whether the product of a price index and a quantity index equals the value index. This test ensures consistency between price and quantity measurements.

**Mathematical Condition:**

**Price Index × Quantity Index = Value Index**

Or:

**(ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × (ΣQ₁P₀ / ΣQ₀P₀) = (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₀)**

**Interpretation:** If prices increase by 20% and quantities increase by 30%, then the total value should increase by 56% (1.20 × 1.30 = 1.56).

**Which Indices Pass This Test?**

| Index Type | Factor Reversal Test | Result |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Simple Aggregative** | ✗ | Fails |
| **Laspeyres' Index** | ✗ | Fails |
| **Paasche's Index** | ✗ | Fails |
| **Fisher's Ideal Index** | ✓ | Passes |

**Why Fisher's Ideal Index is "Ideal":**

Fisher's Ideal Index is the **only index that satisfies both** the Time Reversal Test and the Factor Reversal Test. This is why it's called "ideal" despite being more complex to calculate.

**Verification Using Our Grocery Data:**

**Fisher's Price Index (Calculated Earlier):**
P₀₁(F) = 112.76

**Fisher's Quantity Index (Similar calculation with quantities):**

Q₀₁(F) = √[(ΣQ₁P₀ / ΣQ₀P₀) × (ΣQ₁P₁ / ΣQ₀P₁)]

Q₀₁(F) = √[(97,600 / 102,000) × (110,060 / 115,000)]

Q₀₁(F) = √[0.9569 × 0.9570] = √0.9158 = 0.9570 or **95.70**

**Value Index:**
V₀₁ = (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100 = (110,060 / 102,000) × 100 = **107.90**

**Factor Reversal Test:**
P₀₁(F) × Q₀₁(F) = 112.76 × 95.70 ÷ 100 = 107.91 ≈ **107.90** ✓

The test is satisfied (minor difference due to rounding).

---

## 7.5 Consumer Price Index (CPI)

### What is the Consumer Price Index?

The **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is one of the most important and widely used economic indicators. It measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

**Simple Definition:** CPI tracks how much more (or less) expensive it has become for an average consumer to purchase a standard basket of goods and services.

### Importance of CPI

**1. Inflation Measurement:**
- CPI is the primary measure of inflation in most countries
- Helps central banks make monetary policy decisions
- Guides government economic policy

**2. Cost of Living Adjustments:**
- Used to adjust wages, salaries, and pensions
- Determines social security benefits
- Guides minimum wage adjustments

**3. Deflating Economic Variables:**
- Converts nominal values to real values
- Removes inflation effect from economic data
- Enables meaningful comparisons over time

**4. Wage Negotiations:**
- Labor unions use CPI in collective bargaining
- Helps ensure wages keep pace with inflation
- Maintains purchasing power of workers

**5. Economic Analysis:**
- Helps assess economic health
- Indicates purchasing power changes
- Guides business planning and forecasting

### Components of CPI

CPI typically includes:

| Category | Examples | Typical Weight |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Food & Beverages** | Groceries, restaurant meals | 15-20% |
| **Housing** | Rent, utilities, maintenance | 30-40% |
| **Apparel** | Clothing, footwear | 3-5% |
| **Transportation** | Vehicle purchases, fuel, public transport | 15-20% |
| **Medical Care** | Healthcare services, medicines | 8-10% |
| **Recreation** | Entertainment, hobbies | 5-7% |
| **Education & Communication** | Tuition, internet, phone | 6-8% |
| **Other** | Personal care, tobacco | 3-5% |

**Note:** Weights vary by country based on typical consumption patterns.

### Construction of CPI

CPI is typically constructed using the **Laspeyres' method** with periodic updates to the base year and basket composition.

**Steps in CPI Construction:**

**Step 1: Define the Consumer Basket**
- Select representative goods and services
- Conduct household expenditure surveys
- Determine consumption patterns

**Step 2: Collect Price Data**
- Survey retail outlets regularly (monthly)
- Record prices for items in the basket
- Ensure consistent quality and specifications

**Step 3: Assign Weights**
- Weight items by their importance in consumer spending
- Based on household expenditure surveys
- Updated periodically (every 5-10 years)

**Step 4: Calculate the Index**
- Use Laspeyres' formula with fixed basket
- Compare current prices to base year prices
- Express as index with base = 100

**Formula:**

**CPI = (ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100**

Where:
- P₁ = Current period price
- P₀ = Base period price
- Q₀ = Base period quantities (weights)

---

## 7.6 Worked Example: Calculating CPI

### Business Scenario: Household Consumer Basket

**Problem Statement:**

The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics wants to calculate the Consumer Price Index for urban households. They have identified a simplified basket of essential items and collected price data for 2023 (base year) and 2024 (current year).

Calculate the CPI for 2024 and interpret the inflation rate.

### Data Table: Consumer Basket

| Item Category | Base Year 2023 | Current Year 2024 | Monthly Expenditure 2023 (Taka) |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
|  | Price (P₀) | Quantity (Q₀) | Price (P₁) | P₀Q₀ |
| Rice (kg) | 60 | 25 | 68 | 1,500 |
| Vegetables (kg) | 40 | 20 | 46 | 800 |
| Meat (kg) | 550 | 4 | 600 | 2,200 |
| Milk (liter) | 75 | 15 | 82 | 1,125 |
| Electricity (units) | 8 | 200 | 9 | 1,600 |
| Gas (m³) | 12 | 50 | 14 | 600 |
| Transportation | 5,000 | 1 | 5,500 | 5,000 |
| Healthcare | 2,000 | 1 | 2,300 | 2,000 |
| Education | 3,000 | 1 | 3,400 | 3,000 |
| Clothing | 4,000 | 1 | 4,200 | 4,000 |

### Solution

#### Step 1: Calculate P₁Q₀ for Each Item

| Item | P₀ | Q₀ | P₁ | P₀Q₀ | P₁Q₀ |
|------|----|----|-------|---------|---------|
| Rice | 60 | 25 | 68 | 1,500 | 1,700 |
| Vegetables | 40 | 20 | 46 | 800 | 920 |
| Meat | 550 | 4 | 600 | 2,200 | 2,400 |
| Milk | 75 | 15 | 82 | 1,125 | 1,230 |
| Electricity | 8 | 200 | 9 | 1,600 | 1,800 |
| Gas | 12 | 50 | 14 | 600 | 700 |
| Transportation | 5,000 | 1 | 5,500 | 5,000 | 5,500 |
| Healthcare | 2,000 | 1 | 2,300 | 2,000 | 2,300 |
| Education | 3,000 | 1 | 3,400 | 3,000 | 3,400 |
| Clothing | 4,000 | 1 | 4,200 | 4,000 | 4,200 |
| **Total** | | | | **21,825** | **24,150** |

**Detailed Calculations:**

**Rice:** P₁Q₀ = 68 × 25 = 1,700
**Vegetables:** P₁Q₀ = 46 × 20 = 920
**Meat:** P₁Q₀ = 600 × 4 = 2,400
**Milk:** P₁Q₀ = 82 × 15 = 1,230
**Electricity:** P₁Q₀ = 9 × 200 = 1,800
**Gas:** P₁Q₀ = 14 × 50 = 700
**Transportation:** P₁Q₀ = 5,500 × 1 = 5,500
**Healthcare:** P₁Q₀ = 2,300 × 1 = 2,300
**Education:** P₁Q₀ = 3,400 × 1 = 3,400
**Clothing:** P₁Q₀ = 4,200 × 1 = 4,200

#### Step 2: Calculate CPI Using Laspeyres' Formula

**CPI₂₀₂₄ = (ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100**

**CPI₂₀₂₄ = (24,150 / 21,825) × 100**

**CPI₂₀₂₄ = 1.1065 × 100**

**CPI₂₀₂₄ = 110.65**

#### Step 3: Calculate Inflation Rate

**Inflation Rate = CPI - 100 = 110.65 - 100 = 10.65%**

Or using the formula:

**Inflation Rate = [(CPI₂₀₂₄ - CPI₂₀₂₃) / CPI₂₀₂₃] × 100**

**Inflation Rate = [(110.65 - 100) / 100] × 100 = 10.65%**

---

### Interpretation and Business Implications

**1. Overall Inflation:**
The CPI of 110.65 indicates that the cost of the consumer basket increased by **10.65%** from 2023 to 2024.

**2. Purchasing Power:**
A household that spent 21,825 Taka monthly in 2023 would need **24,150 Taka** in 2024 to maintain the same standard of living.

**3. Real Income Effect:**
If wages increased by less than 10.65%, workers experienced a **decrease in real income** and purchasing power.

**4. Individual Item Analysis:**

| Item | Price Increase | Impact Level |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Rice | 13.3% | High impact (staple) |
| Meat | 9.1% | Moderate |
| Gas | 16.7% | High impact |
| Education | 13.3% | High impact |
| Healthcare | 15.0% | High impact |

**5. Policy Implications:**

**For Government:**
- Consider subsidies for essential items showing high inflation
- Review minimum wage to ensure it keeps pace with CPI
- Monitor food security concerns
- Adjust social welfare payments

**For Businesses:**
- Review employee compensation to retain talent
- Adjust pricing strategies to maintain margins
- Consider cost-cutting measures
- Plan for input cost increases

**For Households:**
- Budget adjustments needed
- Consider substitution of expensive items
- Increase savings to maintain future purchasing power
- Negotiate wage increases citing CPI data

**6. Deflating Nominal Values:**

To convert nominal income to real income:

**Real Income = (Nominal Income / CPI) × 100**

Example: If someone earned 50,000 Taka in 2024:
**Real Income = (50,000 / 110.65) × 100 = 45,189 Taka**

This means their 2024 income of 50,000 Taka has the same purchasing power as 45,189 Taka in 2023.

## 7.7 Limitations of Index Numbers

While index numbers are powerful tools, they have several limitations:

**1. Based on Samples:**
- Not all items or prices can be included
- Sample may not represent all consumers
- Different households have different consumption patterns

**2. Base Year Selection:**
- Choice of base year affects comparisons
- Outdated base years reduce relevance
- Requires periodic revision

**3. Quality Changes Ignored:**
- Difficult to account for quality improvements
- New products create measurement challenges
- Substitution effects not fully captured

**4. Formula Bias:**
- Laspeyres tends to overstate inflation
- Paasche tends to understate inflation
- No perfect formula exists

**5. Aggregation Issues:**
- Individual experiences may differ from average
- Regional variations not captured
- Different income groups affected differently

**6. Purpose Limitation:**
- A single index cannot serve all purposes
- Wholesale price index differs from consumer price index
- Different indices needed for different analyses

## 7.8 Chapter Summary

### Key Concepts Learned

**1. Index Numbers Fundamentals:**
- Statistical measures showing relative changes over time
- Express current values as percentages of base period values
- Essential tools for economic and business analysis

**2. Construction Methods:**

| Method | Formula | Uses | Limitation |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| **Simple Aggregative** | (ΣP₁/ΣP₀) × 100 | Quick estimates | Ignores importance |
| **Laspeyres** | (ΣP₁Q₀/ΣP₀Q₀) × 100 | CPI, most common | Upward bias |
| **Paasche** | (ΣP₁Q₁/ΣP₀Q₁) × 100 | GDP deflator | Downward bias |
| **Fisher's Ideal** | √(L × P) | Theoretical studies | Complex calculation |

**3. Tests of Adequacy:**
- **Time Reversal Test:** Checks temporal consistency
- **Factor Reversal Test:** Ensures price-quantity consistency
- **Fisher's Ideal Index:** Only method passing both tests

**4. Consumer Price Index:**
- Most important economic indicator for inflation
- Affects wage adjustments, policy decisions, and economic planning
- Constructed using Laspeyres method with periodic updates

### Practical Applications

**Business Managers Should Use Index Numbers To:**
- Monitor inflation and adjust pricing strategies
- Plan salary and wage adjustments
- Forecast costs and revenues
- Deflate financial statements for real comparisons
- Benchmark performance against industry indices

**Economists Use Index Numbers To:**
- Measure economic growth and inflation
- Formulate monetary and fiscal policies
- Compare economic conditions across time and regions
- Assess purchasing power changes

### Formula Summary

**Basic Index:** (Current Value / Base Value) × 100

**Laspeyres:** (ΣP₁Q₀ / ΣP₀Q₀) × 100

**Paasche:** (ΣP₁Q₁ / ΣP₀Q₁) × 100

**Fisher's Ideal:** √(Laspeyres × Paasche)

**Inflation Rate:** [(CPI_current - CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] × 100

**Real Value:** (Nominal Value / Price Index) × 100

## 7.9 Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** 
A company tracks three raw material prices. In 2023: Steel (₹500/ton), Copper (₹600/kg), Aluminum (₹300/kg). In 2024: Steel (₹550/ton), Copper (₹660/kg), Aluminum (₹330/kg). Calculate the simple aggregative price index.

**Problem 2:**
Using the following data, calculate Laspeyres, Paasche, and Fisher's Ideal indices:

| Item | P₀ | Q₀ | P₁ | Q₁ |
|------|----|----|----|----|
| A | 10 | 50 | 12 | 55 |
| B | 20 | 30 | 24 | 28 |
| C | 15 | 40 | 18 | 42 |

**Problem 3:**
If the CPI was 100 in 2020 and 125 in 2024, what is the average annual inflation rate?

**Problem 4:**
Verify whether Fisher's Ideal Index satisfies the Factor Reversal Test using the data from Problem 2.

**Problem 5:**
A worker earned ₹30,000 per month in 2020 when CPI was 100. In 2024, they earn ₹40,000 per month when CPI is 130. Calculate their real income change.
