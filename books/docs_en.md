# Developer Introduction

Welcome to **Digital E-Book**, a modern, fast, and lightweight reading application designed for simplicity and performance.

### The Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate the power of **Vanilla JavaScript**. In an era dominated by heavy frameworks like React or Angular, this app proves that you can build a fully functional, Single Page Application (SPA) with routing and state management using only native browser technologies.

### About Me
I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer who loves experimenting with web technologies. I believe in clean code, performance optimization, and creating intuitive user experiences.
