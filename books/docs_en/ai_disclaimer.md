Please be advised that a significant portion of the content, books, and summaries available within this library may have been generated using **Artificial Intelligence** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

### Important Notes
While we strive for quality, AI-generated content comes with inherent limitations:

1.  **Accuracy:** AI models can occasionally produce "hallucinations" or incorrect facts, especially regarding historical events or niche scientific data.
2.  **Context:** The AI might lack current real-world context if the knowledge cutoff date has passed.
3.  **Bias:** Content may reflect biases present in the training data.

> **Reader Advisory:** If you are using this app for academic research or critical professional work, please verify the information against primary sources.

We continuously review and update the prompts used to generate books to ensure the highest possible quality.
