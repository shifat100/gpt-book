# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I add my own books?**
**A:** It's simple! Create a folder for your book, add your `.md` files there, and then add an entry to the `books.json` file pointing to your folder and files.

**Q: Does this app work offline?**
**A:** Yes, partially. If you are running it on a local server (localhost), it works without internet. However, since it uses CDN links for the libraries (Markdown-it, React, etc.), you need an internet connection for the initial load unless you download those libraries locally.

**Q: How do I switch to Dark Mode?**
**A:** Use the floating control bar at the bottom of the screen. Click the **Theme Icon** (Sun/Moon) to cycle between White, Sepia, and Black (Dark) modes.

**Q: Can I print a specific chapter?**
**A:** Yes. Go to the Table of Contents (Index) page of a book. Click the **PDF** button. You can select specific chapters or the entire book to print or save as PDF.

**Q: How does the search work?**
**A:** Click the Search icon in the control bar. You can search by Book Title, Chapter Title, or even the content inside the chapters. The search happens instantly in your browser.
