## 3.1 UNDERSTANDING FOREIGN MARKET OPERATIONS

### 3.1.1 The Role of Intermediaries in International Trade

When a Bangladeshi exporter decides to enter foreign markets, one of the most critical decisions is how to establish market presence. While direct operations (own sales offices) are ideal, they require substantial investment and commitment. For most exporters, especially small and medium enterprises, working through local intermediaries is the practical and cost-effective approach.

**Why Use Intermediaries?**

- Knowledge of customer preferences and buying behavior
- Awareness of competitive landscape
- Insights into cultural and social norms

**Reduced Risk:**
- Share market development costs
- Lower financial commitment
- Flexibility to change or expand
- Test market potential before major investment

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Handle local logistics and distribution
- Manage local marketing and promotion
- Provide after-sales service
- Deal with local regulations and compliance

**Resource Optimization:**

- Avoid managing distant operations
- Leverage intermediary's infrastructure
- Scale operations more efficiently

## 3.2 DISTINCTION BETWEEN SALES AGENTS AND DISTRIBUTORS

Understanding the fundamental differences between agents and distributors is critical for making the right choice for your market entry strategy.

### 3.2.1 Sales Agent (Commission Agent)

**Definition:**
A sales agent is an independent representative who acts on behalf of the exporter to solicit orders from customers in the foreign market. The agent does not take ownership of the goods.

**Key Characteristics:**

**Ownership:**
- Agent does NOT buy or own the goods
- Acts as intermediary between exporter and buyer
- Goods shipped directly from exporter to customer

**Legal Relationship:**
- Agent acts as representative of the principal (exporter)
- Creates binding obligations on the principal
- Agency relationship governed by agency law

**Payment Structure:**
- Earns commission on sales generated
- Commission typically percentage of sales value
- No revenue from product margin
- Commission paid after payment received from customer

**Financial Risk:**
- Minimal financial risk
- Does not invest in inventory
- May incur marketing and operational costs
- Credit risk usually on principal

**Authority:**
- May or may not have authority to conclude contracts
- Can be "selling agent" (no contract authority) or "authorized agent" (can bind principal)
- Authority limits specified in agreement
- Must act within granted powers

**Example Scenario:**
> A Bangladeshi garment exporter appoints Mr. Ahmed as their agent in Germany. Mr. Ahmed shows samples to German retailers, negotiates terms, and forwards orders to Bangladesh. The exporter ships directly to the German retailer. Upon payment, the exporter pays Mr. Ahmed 5% commission.

---

### 3.2.2 Distributor

**Definition:**
A distributor is an independent business entity that purchases products from the exporter and resells them to customers in the foreign market. The distributor takes ownership of the goods.

**Key Characteristics:**

**Ownership:**
- Distributor BUYS goods from exporter
- Takes title and ownership
- Assumes inventory risk
- Resells to customers at their own pricing

**Legal Relationship:**
- Independent buyer-seller relationship
- Not an agent of the exporter
- Acts in own capacity, not as representative
- Governed by sales contract, not agency law

**Payment Structure:**
- Buys at agreed price from exporter
- Earns profit margin on resale
- No commission structure
- Profit comes from price difference

**Financial Risk:**
- Significant financial investment in inventory
- Bears risk of unsold stock
- Credit risk from their customers
- Market risk and obsolescence risk

**Authority:**
- Acts independently
- Sets own resale prices (usually)
- Manages own customer relationships
- No authority to bind exporter

**Example Scenario:**
> A Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company sells medicines to XYZ Distributors in Kenya at $80 per unit. XYZ Distributors pays for a container load, stores inventory, and sells to Kenyan pharmacies at $100 per unit. They earn $20 per unit profit and bear the risk of inventory.

---

### 3.2.3 Comparative Analysis

| **Factor** | **Sales Agent** | **Distributor** |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Ownership of Goods** | NO - remains with exporter | YES - purchases and owns goods |
| **Title to Goods** | Does not take title | Takes title upon purchase |
| **Relationship** | Principal-Agent | Buyer-Seller |
| **Income Source** | Commission on sales | Profit margin on resale |
| **Financial Investment** | Minimal (marketing costs) | Substantial (inventory investment) |
| **Inventory Holding** | No | Yes |
| **Pricing to End Customer** | Set by exporter (usually) | Set by distributor |
| **Credit Risk** | On exporter (usually) | On distributor |
| **Control by Exporter** | Higher | Lower |
| **Market Coverage** | May be limited | Usually wider |
| **After-Sales Service** | Limited | More comprehensive |
| **Payment Terms** | Commission after collection | Pays exporter upfront or on credit |
| **Exclusivity** | Can be exclusive or non-exclusive | Usually exclusive |
| **Marketing Investment** | Shared | Primarily distributor |
| **Legal Complexity** | Higher (agency law) | Lower (sales contract) |
| **Termination** | More regulated, complex | Generally simpler |

### 3.2.4 Advantages and Disadvantages

**Sales Agent:**

**Advantages:**

- Direct relationship with end customers
- Flexibility in market strategy
- Commission paid only on actual sales

**Disadvantages:**

- Lower motivation for aggressive selling

**Distributor:**

**Advantages:**
- Strong motivation to sell (owns inventory)

- Better market coverage and service
- Handles local logistics and credit
- Stronger local presence
- Simplifies exporter's operations

**Disadvantages:**

---

### 3.2.5 When to Choose Agent vs. Distributor

**Choose Sales Agent When:**
- High-value or specialized products requiring technical expertise
- Maintaining price control is critical
- Direct customer relationship is important
- Market testing before major commitment
- Limited production capacity
- Product requires customization
- After-sales service directly from manufacturer

**Example:** Industrial machinery, specialized chemicals, custom software

**Choose Distributor When:**
- Standard products with proven market demand
- Wide market coverage needed quickly
- Product requires local stock for quick delivery
- After-sales service can be handled locally
- Want to minimize operational complexity
- Product suitable for local warehousing
- Distributor brings established customer base

**Example:** Consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, electronics, food products

**Mixed Approach:**
Some exporters use both simultaneously:
- Agents for major accounts or complex sales
- Distributors for standard products to smaller customers
- Geographic split (agents in some countries, distributors in others)

## Case Study: Trouble in Paradise - Representative Relationship Gone Wrong

**Background:**

Green Garments Ltd., a Bangladeshi knitwear exporter, appointed Fashion Distributors Inc. as their exclusive distributor for the Canadian market two years ago. The relationship started well, but problems have emerged.

**Agreement Terms:**
- Exclusive distributorship for all of Canada
- Minimum annual purchase: $500,000
- 30% advance, 70% against shipping documents
- 3-year agreement with 6-month termination notice

**Current Situation:**

**Year 1 Performance:**
- Purchases: $550,000 (exceeded minimum)
- Payment on time
- Good feedback and cooperation

**Year 2 Problems:**
- Purchases: Only $300,000 (well below minimum)
- Two payments delayed by 30+ days
- Distributor claims quality issues (some legitimate, some disputed)
- Distributor requesting price reductions to compete
- Green Garments received direct inquiries from major Canadian retailers but had to refuse due to exclusivity

**Distributor's Position:**
- Market more competitive than expected
- Needs lower prices to compete with Chinese suppliers
- Claims Green Garments' lead times too long
- Wants to return some slow-moving inventory
- Requests more marketing support

**Green Garments' Position:**
- Frustrated with underperformance
- Believes distributor not putting enough effort
- Direct inquiries suggest market potential exists
- Quality claims exaggerated
- Considering termination

**Questions:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** What went wrong in this relationship? Identify all contributing factors from both sides.

2. **Agreement Review:** What clauses should have been included in the original agreement to prevent or address these issues?

3. **Resolution Options:** What are Green Garments' options at this point? Analyze each option with pros and cons.

4. **Performance Management:** If Green Garments decides to continue the relationship, what performance improvement plan should they implement?

5. **Termination Decision:** If Green Garments decides to terminate, what steps should they follow? What are the legal and business considerations?

6. **Lessons Learned:** What lessons can be learned from this case for future representative appointments?

7. **Prevention:** How could Green Garments have better managed this relationship from the beginning?

**Submission Format:** Prepare a 10-12 page report addressing all questions with analysis, recommendations, and supporting arguments. Include draft clauses or documents where relevant.
