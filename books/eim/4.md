# **CHAPTER 4: PRICING IN EXPORT-IMPORT MANAGEMENT**

## **Introduction**

Pricing is one of the most critical elements in international trade. Unlike domestic transactions, export-import pricing involves multiple cost components, currency fluctuations, transportation expenses, insurance, and various documentation charges. A well-prepared quotation not only reflects the true cost but also positions your product competitively in the global market.

For Bangladeshi exporters, understanding costing structures and mastering quotation preparation is essential for sustainable business operations. This chapter explores the systematic approach to export costing, quotation preparation, negotiation strategies, and standard pricing terms used in international trade.

## **4.1 Understanding Export Quotations**

### **4.1.1 What is a Price Quotation?**

A **price quotation** (also called a proforma invoice) is a formal document sent by the exporter to a potential buyer stating the price, terms of sale, delivery conditions, and other relevant commercial details. It serves as:

- An offer to sell goods at specified prices
- A preliminary agreement before the final sales contract
- A basis for Letter of Credit (L/C) opening by the buyer
- A reference document for customs valuation

### **4.1.2 Types of Enquiries**

Exporters receive two types of enquiries:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Response Strategy** |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Solicited Enquiry** | Enquiries received in response to your marketing efforts (advertisements, trade fairs, direct marketing) | Respond promptly with detailed quotation |
| **Unsolicited Enquiry** | Unexpected enquiries from unknown buyers (via email, trade portals, referrals) | Verify buyer credentials before sharing detailed pricing; respond professionally |

### **4.1.3 Key Aspects of Preparing a Price Quotation**

When preparing an export quotation, consider the following essential aspects:

#### **A. Product Specifications**
- Accurate product description
- HS Code (Harmonized System Code) for customs classification
- Quality standards and certifications
- Quantity (units, weight, volume)
- Packaging details

#### **B. Pricing Components**
- Unit price and total value
- Currency of quotation (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- Price validity period (typically 15-30 days)
- Payment terms (Advance, L/C, D/P, D/A, Open Account)

#### **C. Delivery Terms**
- Incoterms (FOB, CFR, CIF, etc.)
- Port of loading (e.g., Chittagong Port, Mongla Port)
- Port of destination
- Expected shipment time

#### **D. Additional Information**
- Minimum order quantity (MOQ)
- Discounts for bulk orders
- Banking details for L/C opening
- Validity of the quotation
- Terms and conditions

### **4.1.4 Responding to Unsolicited Enquiries**

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

```
Step 1: Verify Buyer Credibility
         ↓
Check company website, business registration, online presence
         ↓
Step 2: Acknowledge Enquiry Promptly
         ↓
Respond within 24-48 hours with preliminary information
         ↓

## **4.2 Price Negotiation Strategies**

### **4.2.1 Understanding Buyer Preferences**

Different buyers prioritize different factors:

| **Buyer Type** | **Primary Concern** | **Negotiation Focus** |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|

Price Per Unit
    ↓
Payment Terms (Advance % vs. L/C)
    ↓
Delivery Schedule
    ↓
Packaging Requirements
    ↓
After-Sales Support
    ↓
Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)
```

### **4.2.3 Ways of Price Negotiation**

**1. Volume-Based Discounts**

## **4.3 Elements of Export Costing**

Export costing is more complex than domestic costing due to multiple additional expenses. Understanding each component is crucial for accurate pricing.

### **4.3.1 Components of Export Costing**

```
TOTAL EXPORT COST = Production Cost + Packaging Cost + Documentation Cost 
                    + Freight Cost + Insurance + Profit Margin
```

Let's examine each element in detail:

---

#### **A. Production Cost**

This is the base manufacturing cost of the product.

**Components:**
- Raw materials
- Direct labor
- Factory overheads (electricity, rent, machinery depreciation)
- Quality control expenses
- Manufacturing wastage

**Calculation Method:**
```
Production Cost per Unit = (Total Raw Material + Labor + Overheads) / Total Units Produced
```

**Example (Readymade Garments - Bangladesh Context):**
- Fabric cost: BDT 150 per piece
- Accessories (buttons, zippers, labels): BDT 20 per piece
- Labor: BDT 30 per piece
- Factory overhead: BDT 25 per piece
- **Total Production Cost = BDT 225 per piece**

---

#### **B. Packaging Cost**

Export packaging must be sturdy enough to withstand international transportation.

**Types of Packaging:**

| **Level** | **Purpose** | **Materials** | **Cost Factor** |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Primary Packaging** | Individual product protection | Polybags, hang tags, cardboard boxes | Low |
| **Secondary Packaging** | Grouping products | Cartons, master boxes | Medium |
| **Tertiary Packaging** | Export shipment | Wooden pallets, stretch film, strapping | High |

**Cost Components:**
- Packaging materials (cartons, polybags, pallets)
- Labeling (brand labels, care labels, barcodes)
- Marking (shipping marks, handling instructions)
- Special packaging for fragile items

**Example:**
- Inner polybag: BDT 5 per piece
- Carton box (50 pieces per carton): BDT 100 per carton = BDT 2 per piece
- Pallet and strapping (for container): BDT 5,000 per container (5,000 pieces) = BDT 1 per piece
- **Total Packaging Cost = BDT 8 per piece**

---

#### **C. Documentation Cost**

Export transactions require various documents, each involving processing fees.

**Key Documents and Associated Costs:**

| **Document** | **Issuing Authority (Bangladesh)** | **Approximate Cost (BDT)** |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Commercial Invoice** | Exporter prepares | Printing: 50-100 |
| **Packing List** | Exporter prepares | Printing: 50-100 |
| **Certificate of Origin** | Bangladesh Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) | 500-1,000 |
| **GSP Certificate** | EPB | 500-1,000 |
| **Bill of Lading (B/L)** | Shipping line | 3,000-5,000 |
| **Insurance Certificate** | Insurance company | Included in premium |
| **Inspection Certificate** | SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek | 5,000-15,000 |
| **Phytosanitary Certificate** | Department of Agricultural Extension | 500-1,500 |
| **Bank Charges** | Negotiating bank | 2,000-5,000 |
| **EXP Form Processing** | Customs | 500-1,000 |

**Total Documentation Cost (Example):** BDT 15,000-30,000 per shipment

**Per Unit Calculation:**
```
If total documentation cost = BDT 20,000
Shipment size = 5,000 pieces
Cost per piece = 20,000 / 5,000 = BDT 4 per piece
```

---

#### **D. Freight Cost**

Freight is the cost of transporting goods from Bangladesh to the buyer's destination.

**Factors Affecting Freight:**
- Mode of transport (Sea, Air, Road)
- Distance and destination
- Weight and volume of cargo (chargeable weight)
- Freight rates (fluctuate based on demand)
- Container type (20ft, 40ft, 40ft HC)

**Sea Freight (Most Common for Bangladesh Exports):**

| **Container Type** | **Capacity** | **Average Cost (Chittagong to Europe)** |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **20ft Container** | ~10-12 MT | USD 1,500 - 2,500 |
| **40ft Container** | ~20-24 MT | USD 2,500 - 4,000 |
| **40ft HC (High Cube)** | ~24-28 MT | USD 2,700 - 4,500 |

**Calculation Example:**
- 40ft container freight: USD 3,000
- Container holds: 5,000 pieces
- Exchange rate: 1 USD = 110 BDT
- **Freight per piece = (3,000 × 110) / 5,000 = BDT 66 per piece**

**Additional Freight-Related Charges:**
- Port handling charges (THC - Terminal Handling Charges)
- Customs clearance at origin port
- Stuffing charges (loading into container)
- Container detention charges (if applicable)

---

#### **E. Insurance Cost**

Marine insurance protects goods against loss or damage during transit.

**Types of Marine Insurance:**

| **Coverage Type** | **Protection Level** | **Premium Rate** |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Institute Cargo Clause A (All Risk)** | Comprehensive - covers all risks | 0.3% - 0.5% of invoice value |
| **Institute Cargo Clause B** | Named perils only | 0.2% - 0.3% of invoice value |
| **Institute Cargo Clause C** | Minimum coverage | 0.1% - 0.2% of invoice value |

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Insurance Premium = (Invoice Value + 10% margin) × Premium Rate
```

**Example:**
- Invoice value: USD 50,000
- Insurance value: USD 50,000 + 10% = USD 55,000
- Premium rate: 0.4%
- **Insurance cost = 55,000 × 0.004 = USD 220**

**In Bangladesh Context:**
- Sadharan Bima Corporation (Government)
- Private insurance companies (Green Delta, Pragati Insurance)
- Premium payment in BDT, certificate issued for USD value

---

#### **F. Other Miscellaneous Costs**

- **Pre-shipment inspection fees** (if required by buyer)
- **Testing and certification charges** (BSCI, OEKO-TEX, ISO)
- **Commission to agents** (if any)
- **Bank charges** (L/C negotiation, SWIFT charges)
- **Export incentives processing** (time and administrative cost)

---

### **4.3.2 Complete Export Costing Example**

**Product:** Men's Cotton T-Shirt (Export to Germany)
**Order Quantity:** 5,000 pieces
**Container:** 40ft

| **Cost Element** | **Calculation** | **Per Unit (BDT)** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Production Cost | Direct calculation | 225.00 |
| Packaging Cost | Materials and cartons | 8.00 |
| Documentation | 20,000 / 5,000 | 4.00 |
| Freight (Sea) | (3,000 USD × 110) / 5,000 | 66.00 |
| Insurance | (220 USD × 110) / 5,000 | 4.84 |
| **Total Cost** | **Sum of all elements** | **307.84** |
| **Profit Margin (15%)** | 307.84 × 0.15 | **46.18** |
| **SELLING PRICE** | **Cost + Profit** | **354.02** |

**Final Export Price:** BDT 354 per piece = **USD 3.22 per piece** (at 110 BDT/USD)

## **4.4 Standard Pricing Terms (Incoterms)**

**Incoterms** (International Commercial Terms) are standardized trade terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions.

### **4.4.1 Most Commonly Used Incoterms in Bangladesh**

#### **1. FOB (Free on Board)**

**Definition:** The seller delivers goods on board the vessel at the named port of shipment.

**Seller's Responsibilities:**

**Price Components (FOB):**
```
FOB Price = Production Cost + Packaging + Local Transport to Port 
            + Port Handling + Documentation + Profit
```

**When to Use:** 
- Buyer has better freight rates
- Buyer wants control over shipping
- Most common for garment exports from Bangladesh

**Example:**
```
FOB Chittagong: USD 3.00 per piece
(Buyer arranges and pays for ocean freight and insurance)
```

---

#### **2. CFR (Cost and Freight)**

**Definition:** The seller delivers goods on board the vessel and pays freight to the destination port, but risk transfers when goods are on board.

**Seller's Responsibilities:**
- All FOB responsibilities, PLUS
- Ocean freight to destination port

**Buyer's Responsibilities:**
- Marine insurance
- Import customs clearance
- Unloading at destination
- Transportation to final destination

**Price Components (CFR):**
```
CFR Price = FOB Price + Ocean Freight
```

**When to Use:**
- Seller has better freight negotiation power
- Simplifies buyer's responsibilities
- Common for bulk shipments

**Example:**
```
CFR Hamburg: USD 3.60 per piece
(Includes freight; buyer arranges insurance)
```

---

#### **3. CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight)**

**Definition:** The seller delivers goods on board the vessel, pays freight and insurance to destination port. Risk still transfers when goods are on board.

**Seller's Responsibilities:**
- All CFR responsibilities, PLUS
- Marine insurance (minimum coverage - Institute Cargo Clause C)

**Buyer's Responsibilities:**
- Import customs clearance
- Unloading at destination
- Transportation to final destination

**Price Components (CIF):**
```
CIF Price = CFR Price + Insurance Premium
```

**When to Use:**
- Most comprehensive pricing for buyer
- Required for many L/C transactions
- Very common in Bangladeshi exports

**Example:**
```
CIF Hamburg: USD 3.65 per piece
(Includes freight and insurance; buyer only handles import clearance)
```

---

### **4.4.2 Comparison of FOB, CFR, and CIF**

| **Aspect** | **FOB** | **CFR** | **CIF** |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Cost Included** | Up to loading on vessel | FOB + Freight | CFR + Insurance |
| **Risk Transfer** | When goods on board | When goods on board | When goods on board |
| **Seller Pays Freight** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Seller Pays Insurance** | No | No | Yes |
| **Most Suitable For** | Experienced buyers | Simplified logistics | Complete pricing clarity |
| **Price Level** | Lowest | Medium | Highest |
| **Popularity in Bangladesh** | Very High | Medium | Very High |

---

### **4.4.3 Pricing Formula Summary**

**Step-by-Step Pricing Calculation:**

```
Step 1: Calculate Total Cost
    Production + Packaging + Documentation + Local Transport

Step 2: Add Profit Margin
    Total Cost × (1 + Profit %)

Step 3: Determine Base Price (EXW/FCA)
    Result from Step 2

Step 4: Add Port Charges (for FOB)
    Base Price + Port Handling + Loading

Step 5: Add Freight (for CFR)
    FOB Price + Ocean Freight

Step 6: Add Insurance (for CIF)
    CFR Price + Marine Insurance

FINAL PRICE = CIF Price (or FOB/CFR as per agreement)
```
