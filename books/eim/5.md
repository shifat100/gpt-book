# **CHAPTER 5: BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT AND EXPORT FINANCING**

## **Introduction**

International trade involves significantly higher risks compared to domestic business. Exporters face uncertainties ranging from non-payment by buyers, currency fluctuations, political instability, cargo damage during transit, to quality disputes. Simultaneously, exporters require substantial working capital to procure raw materials, manufacture goods, and fulfill orders before receiving payment from overseas buyers.

This chapter is divided into two comprehensive sections:

**Section A** addresses various types of business risks in export-import trade and explores practical strategies for managing and mitigating these risks, with special emphasis on quality control and inspection mechanisms.

**Section B** focuses on export financing, examining how Bangladeshi exporters can secure funding at different stages of the export process, understand banking relationships, and meet collateral requirements.

Mastering risk management and financing strategies is essential for sustainable and profitable export operations.

### **5A.2.5 Foreign Exchange (Forex) Risks**

**Definition:** Risk of financial loss due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the time of quotation and payment receipt.

#### **Understanding Forex Risk**

**Scenario Example:**

```
Date: January 1, 2025
Exporter quotes: USD 50,000
Expected BDT receipt: 50,000 × 110 = BDT 55,00,000
    ↓
Date: March 1, 2025 (Payment Received)
Actual exchange rate: 1 USD = 108 BDT
Actual BDT receipt: 50,000 × 108 = BDT 54,00,000
    ↓
Loss due to Forex: BDT 1,00,000 (approximately USD 925)
```

**Impact:** The exporter loses BDT 1 lakh despite receiving full USD payment.

#### **Factors Affecting Exchange Rates:**

- **Economic Indicators:** GDP growth, inflation, interest rates
- **Political Stability:** Elections, policy changes
- **Trade Balance:** Export vs. import volumes
- **Foreign Investment Flows:** FDI and portfolio investments
- **Central Bank Policies:** Bangladesh Bank's monetary policy
- **Global Events:** Economic crises, geopolitical tensions

#### **Types of Forex Exposure:**

**A. Transaction Exposure**
- Risk between quote date and payment date
- Most common for exporters
- Example: Price quoted in USD but costs in BDT

**B. Translation Exposure**
- Risk when converting foreign currency assets/liabilities for accounting
- Affects financial statements
- Less relevant for small exporters

**C. Economic Exposure**
- Long-term risk affecting competitiveness
- Example: Sustained BDT appreciation makes Bangladesh exports expensive

#### **Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Forward Contracts (Forex Hedging)**

**Definition:** Agreement with a bank to exchange currency at a predetermined rate on a future date.

**How It Works:**
```
Today (January 1):
    Exporter signs forward contract with bank
    Agrees to sell USD 50,000 at rate of 109 BDT/USD on March 1
    ↓
March 1 (Payment Date):
    Regardless of actual market rate (could be 107 or 112)
    Bank buys USD at agreed rate: 109 BDT/USD
    Exporter receives: 50,000 × 109 = BDT 54,50,000
    ↓
Result: Exchange rate locked, risk eliminated
```

**Advantages:**
- Complete protection against adverse rate movements
- Predictable cash flows
- Easier financial planning

**Disadvantages:**
- Cannot benefit if exchange rate moves favorably
- Requires bank relationship and documentation
- May involve small fees

**Bangladesh Context:**
- Available from major commercial banks (Standard Chartered, HSBC, local banks)
- Requires export documents and proven track record
- Typically for amounts above USD 10,000
- Contract validity: 30 days to 12 months

**2. Currency Clauses in Contracts**

**Option A: Price Adjustment Clause**
```
"If USD/BDT exchange rate varies by more than 2% from the rate on 
quotation date, the price will be adjusted proportionally."
```

**Option B: Multi-Currency Pricing**
```
Offer prices in both USD and EUR, letting buyer choose based on 
their preference and currency strength.
```

**3. Natural Hedging**

**Strategy:** Match currency of income with currency of expenses.

**Example:**
- If you export to Europe (receive EUR) and import fabric from Europe (pay EUR)
- EUR received = EUR spent
- Natural hedge created, reducing net exposure

**4. Invoice in Stable Currency**

**Currency Selection:**

| **Currency** | **Stability** | **Bangladesh Exporter Preference** |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **USD** | Most stable and widely accepted | Highest preference (90%+ exports) |
| **EUR** | Stable, fluctuates vs. USD | Preferred for European buyers |
| **GBP** | Stable, post-Brexit volatility | Used for UK buyers |
| **JPY** | Stable, used for Japan trade | Limited use |
| **BDT** | Not internationally accepted | Not feasible for exports |

**Recommendation:** Invoice in USD for maximum stability and universal acceptance.

**5. Shorter Payment Terms**

- **Reduce exposure duration:** Instead of 90-day credit, negotiate 30-day payment
- **Advance payment:** Request 30-50% advance to lock in exchange rate partially
- **At-sight L/C:** Payment upon document presentation, minimizing time gap

**6. Regular Monitoring**

- Track USD/BDT exchange rates daily
- Use Bloomberg, XE.com, Bangladesh Bank website
- Set rate alerts on banking apps
- Convert foreign currency promptly upon receipt

**7. Consult Treasury/Finance Experts**

- Larger exporters can hire forex consultants
- Banks offer treasury advisory services
- Trade associations provide guidance on forex management

# **SECTION B: EXPORT FINANCING**

## **5B.1 Understanding Export Financing Needs**

Export business is capital-intensive. Unlike domestic sales where payment cycles are shorter, export transactions involve extended timelines from order receipt to final payment realization.

### **5B.1.1 Typical Export Timeline and Cash Flow Challenge**

```
Day 0: Order Received from Buyer
    ↓
Day 1-15: Raw Material Purchase (CASH OUTFLOW)
    ↓
Day 16-45: Production (CASH OUTFLOW - labor, utilities, overheads)
    ↓
Day 46-50: Inspection, Packing, Documentation
    ↓
Day 51: Shipment (CASH OUTFLOW - freight, insurance)
    ↓
Day 51-80: Goods in Transit
    ↓
Day 81-110: Buyer receives goods, processes L/C documents
    ↓
Day 111: PAYMENT RECEIVED (CASH INFLOW)
```

**Cash Flow Gap:** 111 days from expenditure to income

**Problem:** Exporter must finance raw materials, production, and shipping for 3-4 months before receiving payment.

---

### **5B.1.2 Identifying Financial Needs**

#### **A. Pre-Shipment Financing Needs**

**Purpose:** Fund activities BEFORE goods are shipped

**Required For:**
- Raw material purchase (fabric, accessories for garments)
- Wages and salaries during production
- Factory overheads (electricity, rent, machinery maintenance)
- Packaging materials
- Quality inspection fees
- Working capital for day-to-day operations

**Amount Needed:** Typically 70-90% of export order value

**Duration:** 60-90 days (from L/C receipt to shipment)

---

#### **B. Post-Shipment Financing Needs**

**Purpose:** Bridge the gap between shipment and payment receipt

**Required For:**
- Meeting new orders while waiting for payment from previous orders
- Paying suppliers who need immediate settlement
- Covering operational expenses during payment wait period
- Maintaining cash flow continuity

**Amount Needed:** Equal to invoice value of shipped goods

**Duration:** 30-120 days (depending on payment terms)

---

#### **C. Working Capital Needs**

**Purpose:** Day-to-day business operations

**Required For:**
- Maintaining adequate inventory
- Managing multiple orders simultaneously
- Covering overhead costs between orders
- Emergency expenses and contingencies

---

### **5B.1.3 Calculating Financing Requirements**

**Example Calculation:**

**Scenario:**
- Export order value: USD 100,000
- Raw material cost: 60% of order value = USD 60,000
- Production cost: 20% = USD 20,000
- Other costs: 10% = USD 10,000
- Production period: 60 days
- Payment terms: L/C at sight (30 days after shipment for document processing)

**Pre-Shipment Finance Needed:**
```
USD 60,000 (materials) + USD 20,000 (production) + USD 10,000 (other)
= USD 90,000 for 60 days
```

**Post-Shipment Finance Needed:**
```
USD 100,000 for 30 days (until L/C payment received)
```

**Total Financing Requirement:** USD 90,000 + USD 100,000 = USD 190,000 over 90-day cycle

---

## **5B.2 Export Financing Options in Bangladesh**

### **5B.2.1 Pre-Shipment Finance (Packing Credit)**

**Definition:** Short-term loan provided by banks to exporters for purchasing raw materials and processing goods for export.

#### **How Pre-Shipment Finance Works:**

```

Step 3: Bank Evaluates L/C and Exporter's Creditworthiness
    ↓
Step 4: Bank Approves Pre-Shipment Finance (up to 90% of L/C value)
    ↓
Step 5: Bank Disburses Loan Amount to Exporter's Account
    ↓
Step 6: Exporter Uses Funds to Purchase Materials and Produce Goods
    ↓
Step 7: Exporter Ships Goods and Submits Documents to Bank
