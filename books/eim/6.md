# **CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMS CLEARANCE OF IMPORT AND EXPORT CARGO**

## **Introduction**

Customs clearance is a critical gateway in international trade. Every shipment crossing international borders must pass through customs authorities who verify compliance with national laws, collect duties and taxes, and ensure prohibited goods don't enter or leave the country.

For Bangladeshi traders, understanding customs procedures is essential for:

- **Compliance:** Meeting legal requirements and avoiding penalties
- **Speed:** Faster clearance reduces demurrage and storage costs
- **Cost Management:** Accurate valuation and classification minimize duty payments
- **Risk Mitigation:** Proper documentation prevents cargo detention or seizure
- **Business Efficiency:** Smooth customs operations improve supply chain performance

This chapter covers the complete customs clearance process in Bangladesh, from import procedures at Chittagong and Mongla ports to export clearance formalities, valuation methods, duty structures, and the Harmonized System (HS) code classification.

# **SECTION A: IMPORT CLEARANCE**

## **6.2 Import Clearance Process in Bangladesh**

Import clearance involves multiple stages from vessel arrival to cargo release. The process is designed to verify legitimacy, assess duties, and ensure compliance before goods enter Bangladesh.

### **6.2.1 Pre-Arrival Requirements**

**Before Vessel Arrives:**

**1. Import Registration Certificate (IRC)**
- Mandatory for all importers (except specific exemptions)
- Valid for 5 years, renewable
- Issued by: Office of Chief Controller of Imports & Exports (CCI&E)

- Import L/C opened with authorized dealer bank
- As per Import Policy guidelines
- Bank retains shipping documents until customs clearance

**3. Import Permit/License (if applicable)**
- Required for restricted items (pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food products)
- Obtained from relevant ministry/department

**4. Advance Cargo Information (ACI)**
- Shipping line submits cargo manifest electronically to customs
- 24 hours before vessel arrival
- Contains: vessel details, container list, cargo description

---

### **6.2.2 Bill of Entry (BE) - The Central Document**

**Definition:** Bill of Entry is the primary customs document filed by importers (or their customs clearing agents) to declare imported goods and request clearance.

**Types of Bill of Entry:**

| **Type** | **Purpose** | **Color Code (Traditional)** |
|---------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Home Consumption (BE-HC)** | Goods for immediate domestic use | White |

**Bill of Entry Contains:**
- Importer's name, address, IRC number
- Description of goods
- HS Code (Harmonized System Code)
- Quantity, weight, volume
- Value (FOB, CFR, CIF)
- Country of origin, port of shipment
- Vessel name, Bill of Lading number
- Applicable duties and taxes

---

### **6.2.3 Step-by-Step Import Clearance Procedure**

#### **Stage 1: Document Submission and BE Filing**

**Step 1: Vessel Arrival and Berthing**
- Shipping line informs importer of vessel arrival
- Vessel berths at Chittagong/Mongla port
- Importer receives notification to begin clearance process

**Step 2: Obtain Delivery Order**
- Importer/clearing agent approaches shipping line
- Submits original Bill of Lading (B/L) or express release
- Shipping line issues **Delivery Order (D/O)** authorizing cargo release
- Shipping line charges: THC (Terminal Handling Charges), documentation fee

**Step 3: Collect Import Documents from Bank**
- Bank releases documents after:
  - L/C payment made (for sight L/C), or
  - Acceptance of documents (for usance L/C), or
  - Trust receipt signed (for deferred payment)
- Documents obtained:
  - Commercial invoice (original)
  - Packing list
  - Bill of Lading (original)
  - Certificate of Origin
  - Insurance certificate
  - Other certificates (quality, inspection, etc.)

**Step 4: Engage Customs Clearing Agent (C&F Agent)**
- Most importers hire licensed C&F (Clearing & Forwarding) agents
- C&F agent fee: 0.5-1% of cargo value (negotiable)
- Agent prepares all customs documentation

**Step 5: Assessment of Goods (Pre-Filing)**
- Determine correct HS Code for imported goods
- Calculate assessable value (CIF + landing charges)
- Compute applicable duties:
  - Customs Duty (CD)
  - Supplementary Duty (SD)
  - Value Added Tax (VAT)
  - Regulatory Duty (RD)
  - Advance Income Tax (AIT)

**Step 6: File Bill of Entry Online**
- Bangladesh uses **ASYCUDA World** system (Automated System for Customs Data)
- C&F agent logs into ASYCUDA portal
- Inputs all cargo details, HS codes, valuation
- System generates BE number (e.g., BE-CHT-2025-12345)
- Electronic submission to customs

---

#### **Stage 2: Document Scrutiny and Assessment**

**Step 7: Customs Document Verification**
- Customs officer reviews submitted documents:
  - Commercial invoice (value verification)
  - Packing list (quantity/weight verification)
  - Certificate of origin (preferential duty eligibility)
  - Import permit (for restricted items)
  - IRC (importer registration check)
- Officer verifies consistency across documents

**Step 8: Risk-Based Selectivity**
- ASYCUDA system automatically assigns risk profile:

| **Channel** | **Risk Level** | **Processing** | **Percentage** |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Green Channel** | Low Risk | Auto-clearance, no physical examination | 15-20% |
| **Yellow Channel** | Medium Risk | Document verification only | 40-50% |
| **Red Channel** | High Risk | Full physical examination required | 30-40% |

- Risk factors considered:
  - Importer's compliance history
  - Type of goods (sensitive items = red channel)
  - Declared value (unusually low = red channel)
  - Country of origin
  - Random selection

**Step 9: Valuation Assessment**
- Customs officer verifies declared CIF value
- Compares with:
  - Previous imports of similar goods
  - Customs valuation database
  - International market prices
- If value appears undervalued → investigation and potential reassessment

**Step 10: Duty Calculation**
- Officer confirms HS Code classification
- Applies tariff rates from Customs Tariff Schedule
- Calculates total duties payable
- System generates **Assessment Notice**

---

#### **Stage 3: Payment of Duties and Taxes**

**Step 11: Receive Assessment Notice**
- ASYCUDA generates assessment with breakdown:

```
Example Assessment:
CIF Value: USD 50,000 × BDT 110 = BDT 55,00,000

Customs Duty (25%):        BDT 13,75,000
Supplementary Duty (0%):   BDT 0
Regulatory Duty (5%):      BDT 2,75,000
VAT (15%):                 BDT 10,72,500
AIT (5%):                  BDT 2,75,000
------------------------------------------
Total Payable:             BDT 29,97,500
```

**Step 12: Pay Duties at Authorized Bank**

# **SECTION C: CUSTOMS VALUATION**

## **6.4 Valuation of Imported Goods**

Customs valuation determines the **assessable value** on which duties and taxes are calculated. Accurate valuation is critical to prevent revenue loss and ensure fair trade.

---

### **6.4.1 Principles of Customs Valuation**

Bangladesh follows **WTO Valuation Agreement** principles:

1. **Primary Basis:** Transaction value (actual price paid or payable)
2. **Objective and Fair:** Based on verifiable commercial data
3. **Non-Discriminatory:** Same rules for all importers
4. **Transparent:** Clear methodology and justification

---

### **6.4.2 Methods of Customs Valuation**

**Six Methods (Applied Sequentially):**

#### **Method 1: Transaction Value Method (Primary Method)**

**Definition:** The price actually paid or payable for goods sold for export to Bangladesh, adjusted for certain costs.

**Formula:**
```
Transaction Value = Invoice Price (FOB/CFR/CIF) + Adjustments
```

**Adjustments (Additions):**
- Commissions (except buying commission)
- Brokerage fees
- Cost of containers/packing
- Assists (materials, tools, engineering provided free by buyer)
- Royalties and license fees
- Proceeds of resale accruing to seller

**Adjustments (Deductions):**
- Buying commissions
- Post-importation costs (installation, maintenance after import)
- Duties and taxes in Bangladesh

**Example:**

```
Invoice Value (FOB): USD 50,000
Freight to Chittagong: USD 2,000
Insurance: USD 300
Royalty for brand use: USD 1,000

Transaction Value (CIF + Royalty):
= 50,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 1,000
= USD 53,300
```

**When Used:** 95%+ of imports use this method

**Rejection Reasons:**
- Price influenced by relationship between buyer-seller (related parties)
- Sale subject to conditions that cannot be quantified
- Proceeds of resale revert to seller
- Restriction on use of goods

---

#### **Method 2: Transaction Value of Identical Goods**

**When Used:** Transaction value cannot be determined

**Definition:** Use transaction value of identical goods sold for export to Bangladesh at/near same time

**Identical Goods Criteria:**
- Same in all respects (physical characteristics, quality, reputation)
- Produced in same country
- Same producer

**Adjustments:** For commercial level, quantity differences, freight/insurance

**Example:**
- Cannot determine value of imported machinery
- Another importer imported identical machinery from same manufacturer last month
- Use that transaction value with necessary adjustments

---

#### **Method 3: Transaction Value of Similar Goods**

**When Used:** Methods 1 and 2 cannot be applied

**Definition:** Use transaction value of similar goods (not identical but close)

**Similar Goods Criteria:**
- Closely resemble in component materials and characteristics
- Commercially interchangeable
- Produced in same country
- Same producer (if possible)

**Example:**
- Imported Samsung 50" LED TV (specific model not previously imported)
- Use value of Samsung 50" LED TV (different model) imported recently
- Adjust for feature/specification differences

---

#### **Method 4: Deductive Value Method**

**When Used:** Methods 1, 2, and 3 cannot be applied

**Definition:** Based on selling price in Bangladesh, working backwards

**Formula:**
```
Customs Value = Sale Price in Bangladesh
                - Profit and General Expenses
                - Inland Transportation and Handling
                - Customs Duties and Taxes Paid
```

**Example:**
```
Imported goods sold in Bangladesh for: BDT 11,00,000
Importer's profit and expenses (20%): BDT 2,20,000
Transport/handling in Bangladesh: BDT 30,000
Customs duties paid: BDT 1,50,000

Deductive Value = 11,00,000 - 2,20,000 - 30,000 - 1,50,000
                = BDT 7,00,000
```

---

#### **Method 5: Computed Value Method**

**When Used:** Methods 1-4 cannot be applied

**Definition:** Build up value based on production costs

**Formula:**
```
Computed Value = Cost of Materials + Manufacturing Cost
                 + Profit and General Expenses
                 + Freight and Insurance
```

**Requirements:**
- Producer must provide cost breakdown
- Customs verifies data
- Include reasonable profit margin

**Example:**
```
Raw material cost: USD 20,000
Manufacturing/labor: USD 15,000
Producer's profit (10%): USD 3,500
Freight: USD 2,000
Insurance: USD 300

Computed Value = 20,000 + 15,000 + 3,500 + 2,000 + 300
                = USD 40,800
```

**Challenge:** Difficult to obtain producer's cost data

---

#### **Method 6: Fall-back/Residual Method**

**When Used:** All above methods cannot be applied

**Definition:** Use reasonable means consistent with principles and provisions of WTO Valuation Agreement

**Options:**
- Modified application of previous methods (with flexibility)
- Reference to similar goods in international markets
- Expert opinion/appraisal
- Published price lists, catalogues

**Restrictions (Cannot Use):**
- Arbitrary or fictitious values
- Selling price in country of exportation
- Higher of two alternative values
- Domestic price of goods in Bangladesh
- Minimum customs values

---

### **6.4.3 Factors Affecting Valuation**

**A. Incoterms and Value Adjustment**

Bangladesh Customs requires **CIF value** for assessment:

| **Incoterm** | **Adjustment Needed** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **FOB** | Add freight + insurance to reach CIF |
| **CFR** | Add insurance to reach CIF |
| **CIF** | No adjustment (already includes Cost, Insurance, Freight) |
| **EXW** | Add inland transport + loading + freight + insurance |
| **FCA/CPT** | Convert to CIF equivalent |

**Example:**
```
Invoice shows: FOB USD 50,000
Freight: USD 2,000
Insurance: USD 300

CIF Value for Customs Assessment: USD 52,300
```

---

**B. Currency Conversion**

**Process:**
- Invoice value in foreign currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Convert to BDT using **customs exchange rate**
- Customs uses **Bangladesh Bank's TT Clean Buying Rate** on assessment date

**Example:**
```
CIF Value: USD 50,000
Customs Exchange Rate (on assessment date): 1 USD = 110 BDT
Assessable Value in BDT: 50,000 × 110 = BDT 55,00,000
```

**Note:** Rate changes daily; timing of assessment affects duty amount

---

**C. Related Party Transactions**

**Issue:** Transactions between related parties (parent-subsidiary, affiliates) may not reflect true market value

**Customs Approach:**
- Scrutinize such transactions closely
- Request additional documentation proving arm's length pricing
- May reject declared value and use alternative method

**Related Parties Include:**
- Officers/directors of each other's businesses
- Partners in same business
- Employer and employee
- Family members
- One controls the other (shareholding >5%)

**Importer's Defense:**
- Provide comparable sales to unrelated parties
- Show transfer pricing documentation
- Demonstrate pricing is consistent with market rates

---

**D. Undervaluation Prevention**

**Why Importers Undervalue:**
- Reduce customs duty burden
- Evade taxes
- Illegal profit maximization

**Customs Detection Methods:**
- **Valuation Database:** Compare with historical data for similar goods
- **Post-Clearance Audit:** Random checks after clearance
- **Risk Profiling:** Flag importers with repeated low valuations
- **Market Intelligence:** Track international commodity prices
- **Physical Examination:** Verify quality justifies declared value

**Consequences of Undervaluation:**
- Duty reassessment with penalty (up to 5x duties evaded)
- Seizure of goods
- Criminal prosecution
- Suspension/cancellation of IRC
- Blacklisting

---

### **6.4.4 Valuation Case Study**

**Scenario:** Bangladeshi importer imports cotton fabric from India

**Invoice Details:**
- Description: 100% cotton fabric, 60,000 meters
- Unit Price: USD 2.50/meter
- Total FOB Value: USD 150,000
- Freight (Mumbai to Chittagong): USD 3,000
- Insurance: USD 900
- Buying Commission (paid to agent in India): USD 2,000

**Customs Valuation:**

```
Step 1: Calculate CIF Value
FOB Value: USD 150,000
Add: Freight: USD 3,000
Add: Insurance: USD 900
CIF Value: USD 153,900

Step 2: Check Adjustments
Buying Commission: NOT added (permissible deduction)
Final Transaction Value: USD 153,900

Step 3: Convert to BDT
Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 110 BDT
Assessable Value: 153,900 × 110 = BDT 1,69,29,000
```

**This value will be used for calculating customs duty, VAT, and other taxes.**

# **SECTION D: CUSTOMS DUTY STRUCTURE**

## **6.5 Types of Customs Duties in Bangladesh**

Bangladesh has a multi-layered duty structure designed to protect domestic industry, generate revenue, and comply with international obligations.

---

### **6.5.1 Customs Duty (CD)**

**Definition:** Basic import duty levied on imported goods as per Customs Tariff Schedule

**Rate:** Varies by product (0% to 25%, some items higher)

**Calculation Base:** CIF value (assessable value)

**Formula:**
```
Customs Duty = CIF Value × CD Rate
```

**Example:**
```
CIF Value: BDT 55,00,000
CD Rate: 25%
Customs Duty = 55,00,000 × 0.25 = BDT 13,75,000
```

**Rate Determinants:**
- **Essential goods:** Low duty (0-5%) - medicines, life-saving equipment
- **Raw materials:** Low to moderate (5-10%) - industrial inputs
- **Consumer goods:** High duty (25%+) - luxury items, finished products
- **Protective duty:** Very high (50-200%) - protect local industry (e.g., local manufacturing)

---

### **6.5.2 Supplementary Duty (SD)**

**Definition:** Additional duty on specific goods, primarily luxury items or goods with negative externalities

**Purpose:**
- Discourage consumption of luxury goods
- Generate additional revenue
- Protect environment/health (tobacco, alcohol)

**Rate:** 0% to 350% (varies widely)

**Calculation Base:** CIF Value + Customs Duty

**Formula:**
```
SD Base = CIF Value + Customs Duty
Supplementary Duty = SD Base × SD Rate
```

**Example:**
```
CIF Value: BDT 55,00,000
Customs Duty (25%): BDT 13,75,000
SD Base: 55,00,000 + 13,75,000 = BDT 68,75,000

SD Rate: 20%
Supplementary Duty = 68,75,000 × 0.20 = BDT 13,75,000
```

**Common SD Rates:**

| **Product** | **SD Rate** |
|------------|-----------|
| Tobacco products | 65% |
| Alcoholic beverages | 350% |
| Luxury cars | 100-250% |
| Cosmetics (non-essential) | 30-60% |
| Air conditioners | 20% |
| Mobile phones (high-end) | 10-25% |

---

### **6.5.3 Value Added Tax (VAT)**

**Definition:** Consumption tax on imported goods

**Standard Rate:** 15% (with some exceptions - 5%, 10%)

**Calculation Base:** CIF + CD + SD

**Formula:**
```
VAT Base = CIF Value + Customs Duty + Supplementary Duty
VAT = VAT Base × 15%
```

**Example:**
```
CIF Value: BDT 55,00,000
Customs Duty: BDT 13,75,000
Supplementary Duty: BDT 13,75,000
VAT Base: 55,00,000 + 13,75,000 + 13,75,000 = BDT 82,50,000

VAT (15%) = 82,50,000 × 0.15 = BDT 12,37,500
```

**VAT Exemptions/Reduced Rates:**
- Essential medicines: 0%
- Agricultural inputs (fertilizer, seeds): 0%
- Books and educational materials: 0%
- Industrial machinery (certain categories): 5%

**Input VAT Credit:**
- Registered VAT payers can claim input VAT credit
- Reduces final VAT liability on sales
- Must maintain proper VAT invoices

---

### **6.5.4 Regulatory Duty (RD)**

**Definition:** Duty imposed to regulate imports, protect domestic industry, or correct trade imbalances

**Nature:** Temporary, frequently adjusted through SROs (Statutory Regulatory Orders)

**Rate:** 0% to 5% (typically)

**Calculation Base:** CIF Value

**Formula:**
```
Regulatory Duty = CIF Value × RD Rate
```

**Example:**
```
CIF Value: BDT 55,00,000
RD Rate: 5%
Regulatory Duty = 55,00,000 × 0.05 = BDT 2,75,000
```

**Purpose:**
- Quick response to trade disturbances
- Protect emerging local industries
- Balance of payments adjustments

---

### **6.5.5 Advance Income Tax (AIT)**

**Definition:** Income tax deducted at import stage, adjustable against annual tax liability

**Rate:** 2% to 5% (varies by importer type and product)

| **Importer Type** | **AIT Rate** |
|------------------|-------------|
| Registered Company/Firm | 2% |
| Individual/Non-registered | 5% |
| Importer without TIN | 5% |

**Calculation Base:** CIF + CD + SD (varies)

**Formula:**
```
AIT Base = CIF Value + Customs Duty + Supplementary Duty
AIT = AIT Base × AIT Rate
```

**Example:**
```
AIT Base: BDT 82,50,000 (CIF + CD + SD)
AIT Rate: 5%
AIT = 82,50,000 × 0.05 = BDT 4,12,500
```

**Tax Credit:**
- AIT is not additional cost
- Adjustable when filing annual income tax return
- If AIT > actual tax liability → refund
- If AIT < actual tax liability → pay difference

---

### **6.5.6 Advance Trade VAT (ATV)**

**Definition:** VAT collected at import for unregistered importers

**Rate:** 5% (on top of regular 15% VAT)

**Applicability:** Importers without VAT registration

**Calculation:** Similar to VAT base

**Purpose:** Encourage VAT registration and compliance

---

### **6.5.7 Complete Duty Calculation Example**

**Imported Product:** Electronic Home Appliance (Air Conditioner)

**Given:**
- FOB Value: USD 40,000
- Freight: USD 1,500
- Insurance: USD 300
- Exchange Rate: 110 BDT/USD
- CD Rate: 25%
- SD Rate: 20%
- VAT Rate: 15%
- RD Rate: 5%
- AIT Rate: 5%

**Calculation:**

```
Step 1: CIF Value
FOB: 40,000 + Freight: 1,500 + Insurance: 300 = USD 41,800
CIF in BDT: 41,800 × 110 = BDT 45,98,000

Step 2: Customs Duty (25% on CIF)
CD = 45,98,000 × 0.25 = BDT 11,49,500

Step 3: Supplementary Duty (20% on CIF + CD)
SD Base = 45,98,000 + 11,49,500 = BDT 57,47,500
SD = 57,47,500 × 0.20 = BDT 11,49,500

Step 4: Regulatory Duty (5% on CIF)
RD = 45,98,000 × 0.05 = BDT 2,29,900

Step 5: VAT (15% on CIF + CD + SD)
VAT Base = 45,98,000 + 11,49,500 + 11,49,500 = BDT 68,97,000
VAT = 68,97,000 × 0.15 = BDT 10,34,550

Step 6: AIT (5% on CIF + CD + SD)
AIT Base = 68,97,000
AIT = 68,97,000 × 0.05 = BDT 3,44,850

TOTAL DUTIES PAYABLE:
CD:  BDT 11,49,500
SD:  BDT 11,49,500
RD:  BDT 2,29,900
VAT: BDT 10,34,550
AIT: BDT 3,44,850
--------------------------
TOTAL: BDT 39,08,300

Total Import Cost = CIF + Total Duties
                  = 45,98,000 + 39,08,300
                  = BDT 85,06,300
```

**Effective Duty Rate:** 85% (duties as % of CIF value)

---

# **SECTION E: HARMONIZED SYSTEM (HS) CODE**

## **6.6 Understanding the Harmonized System**

### **6.6.1 What is HS Code?**

**Definition:** The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is an internationally standardized system of names and numbers to classify traded products.

**Developed By:** World Customs Organization (WCO)

**Purpose:**
- Uniform classification globally
- Facilitate international trade
- Standardize customs procedures
- Enable trade statistics compilation
- Determine applicable duties and regulations

**Adoption:** Used by 200+ countries, covering 98% of world trade

---

### **6.6.2 HS Code Structure**

**Format:** Minimum 6 digits internationally; countries add further digits for specificity

**Bangladesh HS Code:** **8 digits** (BTCL - Bangladesh Tariff Classification List)

**Structure Breakdown:**

```
HS Code: 6109.10.00

61      = Chapter (Articles of apparel, knitted or crocheted)
6109    = Heading (T-shirts, singlets, and other vests, knitted)
6109.10 = Subheading (Of cotton)
6109.10.00 = National subheading (Bangladesh-specific detail)
```

**Hierarchical Structure:**

```
Section (Broad category, e.g., Section XI: Textiles)
    ↓
Chapter (2 digits, e.g., 61: Knitted apparel)
    ↓
Heading (4 digits, e.g., 6109: T-shirts)
    ↓
Subheading (6 digits, e.g., 6109.10: Cotton t-shirts)
    ↓

---

### **6.6.4 Importance of Correct HS Code Classification**

**Why It Matters:**

**1. Duty Determination**
- Different HS codes = different duty rates
- Incorrect code = wrong duty calculation
- Can result in overpayment or underpayment

**Example:**
```
Product: Cotton T-shirt
Correct HS Code: 6109.10.00 (CD: 25%)
Incorrect code: 6109.90.00 (of other materials, CD: 30%)
Impact: 5% extra duty if misclassified
```

**2. Trade Preferences**
- GSP eligibility depends on correct HS code
- Preferential tariffs under FTAs require accurate classification
- Wrong code = lose duty-free access

**3. Import/Export Restrictions**
- Some HS codes require licenses/permits
- Restricted items identified by HS code
- Wrong code = regulatory violations

**4. Trade Statistics**
- Governments track imports/exports by HS code
- Economic policies based on this data
- Accurate classification ensures reliable statistics

**5. Legal Compliance**
- Misclassification (intentional) is fraud
- Penalties and criminal prosecution possible
- Blacklisting of importer/exporter

---

### **6.6.5 How to Determine HS Code**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Identify the Product Clearly**
- Exact description (material, function, construction)
- Composition percentages (if mixed materials)
- Primary use/purpose

**Step 2: Consult HS Nomenclature**
- Access Bangladesh Customs Tariff (available at NBR website)
- Start with Section, narrow to Chapter, then Heading

**Step 3: Apply General Rules of Interpretation (GRI)**

**GRI 1:** Classification determined by headings and section/chapter notes
**GRI 2:** Incomplete/unfinished articles classified as complete if they have essential character
**GRI 3:** When two or more headings apply, use:
   - 3(a): Most specific description preferred
   - 3(b): Material/component giving essential character
   - 3(c): Last heading in numerical order
**GRI 4:** Goods not classifiable above → most similar goods
**GRI 5:** Packing containers classified with goods if normally sold together
**GRI 6:** Subheading classification uses same rules

**Step 4: Verify with Customs**
- If uncertain, request advance ruling from customs
- Submit product sample and description
- Customs issues binding classification decision

**Step 5: Document Classification Rationale**
- Maintain records of why specific HS code chosen
- Useful in case of audit or dispute
