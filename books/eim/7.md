# **CHAPTER 7: EXPORT-IMPORT DOCUMENTATION**

## **Introduction**

Documentation is the backbone of international trade. Unlike domestic transactions where goods and payment are exchanged simultaneously, export-import involves parties separated by thousands of miles, different legal systems, and significant time gaps. Documentation serves as:

- **Legal Evidence:** Proof of contract, ownership, and transaction terms
- **Payment Security:** Banks rely on documents to release payment
- **Customs Compliance:** Required for import/export clearance
- **Risk Mitigation:** Protects both buyer and seller interests
- **Logistics Coordination:** Facilitates smooth cargo movement

For Bangladeshi exporters and importers, mastering documentation—especially the Letter of Credit mechanism—is essential for:

- **Securing Payment:** Ensuring foreign buyers pay as agreed
- **Accessing Finance:** Banks provide pre/post-shipment finance against L/Cs
- **Maintaining Credibility:** Professional documentation builds buyer trust
- **Avoiding Delays:** Correct documents prevent shipment holds and payment delays
- **Managing Working Capital:** Back-to-Back L/Cs enable cash-free raw material procurement

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of export-import documentation, with particular focus on Letters of Credit (L/C), Back-to-Back L/Cs (critical for Bangladesh's RMG sector), document types, discrepancy management, and payment claiming procedures.

# **SECTION A: LETTER OF CREDIT (L/C)**

## **7.1 Understanding Letter of Credit**

### **7.1.1 What is a Letter of Credit?**

**Definition:** A Letter of Credit (L/C), also called Documentary Credit, is a written commitment by a bank (Issuing Bank) on behalf of a buyer (Applicant/Importer) to pay the seller (Beneficiary/Exporter) a specified amount, provided the seller presents complying documents within a specified time.

**Governed By:** Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) - International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules

**Key Principle:** **"Documents, not goods"** - Banks deal with documents only, not physical goods. Payment based on document compliance, not cargo quality.

---

### **7.1.2 Parties Involved in L/C**

```

**Eight Key Parties:**

| **Party** | **Role** | **Example (Bangladesh Context)** |
|----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| **Applicant (Buyer/Importer)** | Requests L/C opening; commits to pay | German fashion retailer |
| **Beneficiary (Seller/Exporter)** | Receives L/C; ships goods; gets paid | Bangladeshi garment manufacturer |
| **Issuing Bank** | Opens L/C on buyer's behalf; guarantees payment | Deutsche Bank (Germany) |
| **Advising Bank** | Informs beneficiary of L/C; verifies authenticity | Standard Chartered Bank (Bangladesh) |
| **Confirming Bank** (optional) | Adds payment guarantee (in addition to issuing bank) | HSBC Bangladesh |
| **Negotiating Bank** | Examines documents; pays beneficiary (often same as advising bank) | Standard Chartered Bank (Bangladesh) |
| **Reimbursing Bank** (optional) | Reimburses negotiating bank on issuing bank's instructions | Citibank (intermediary) |
| **Nominated Bank** | Bank authorized to pay/negotiate (may be advising bank) | Standard Chartered Bank (Bangladesh) |

---

### **7.1.3 Types of Letters of Credit**

#### **A. Based on Payment Security**

**1. Revocable L/C**
- Can be amended/cancelled by issuing bank without beneficiary consent
- **Rarely used today** (high risk for exporter)
- UCP 600 considers all L/Cs irrevocable unless stated otherwise

**2. Irrevocable L/C**
- **Cannot be amended/cancelled** without agreement of all parties
- **Standard in international trade**
- Provides payment security to exporter

**3. Confirmed L/C**
- Payment guaranteed by **two banks**: issuing bank AND confirming bank
- **Maximum security** for exporter
- Useful when buyer's bank/country has political/credit risk

**Example (Bangladesh Context):**
```
Bangladeshi exporter shipping to a buyer in a politically unstable country:
- Buyer's bank (Issuing Bank): Local bank in unstable country
- Risk: Political events may prevent payment
- Solution: Request confirmation from HSBC Bangladesh (Confirming Bank)
- Result: If issuing bank fails to pay, HSBC Bangladesh pays from its own funds
- Cost: Confirmation charges (0.5-2% of L/C value, paid by buyer or negotiated)
```

---

#### **B. Based on Payment Timing**

**1. Sight L/C (At Sight L/C)**
- Payment made **immediately** upon presentation of complying documents
- Typically 5-7 days for document examination
- **Most common** for Bangladeshi exports

**2. Usance L/C (Deferred Payment L/C)**
- Payment made after a **specified period** (30, 60, 90, 180 days after sight/shipment)
- Buyer gets credit period
- Exporter waits longer but can discount with bank

**Comparison:**

| **Aspect** | **Sight L/C** | **Usance L/C (90 Days)** |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Exporter Payment** | 7-10 days after shipment | 97-100 days after shipment |
| **Buyer Payment** | Immediately | 90 days after receiving documents |
| **Exporter Preference** | High (quick payment) | Lower (long wait) |
| **Buyer Preference** | Lower (immediate payment) | High (credit period) |
| **Discounting Option** | N/A | Exporter can discount for early payment (with charges) |

---

#### **C. Based on Transferability**

**1. Transferable L/C**
- Beneficiary can **transfer** L/C to one or more second beneficiaries
- Useful for **trading houses** and **intermediaries**
- First beneficiary (middleman) transfers to actual supplier

**Example:**
```
German buyer → Opens L/C for USD 100,000 → Bangladeshi Trading House
                                                    ↓
                                         Transfers USD 80,000
                                                    ↓
                                           Actual Manufacturer
                                           (Second Beneficiary)

- Manufacturer ships goods, submits documents
- Bank pays manufacturer USD 80,000
- Trading house receives USD 20,000 (commission/margin)
```

**2. Non-Transferable L/C**
- **Cannot be transferred** to third party
- Original beneficiary must fulfill obligations
- **Most common** type

---

#### **D. Based on Revolving Nature**

**1. Revolving L/C**
- Automatically **renews** for multiple shipments
- Useful for regular supply contracts
- Value/quantity revolves (e.g., USD 50,000 monthly for 12 months)

**2. Non-Revolving L/C**
- **Single shipment** only
- Expires after one transaction

---

#### **E. Based on Payment Method**

**1. Red Clause L/C**
- Allows **advance payment** to exporter before shipment
- Buyer authorizes issuing bank to advance funds for production
- Rare; requires strong buyer-seller trust

**2. Green Clause L/C**
- Advance payment for **warehousing** in addition to production
- Very rare; extended version of Red Clause

**3. Back-to-Back L/C** *(Covered in detail in Section 7.2)*
- Exporter uses buyer's L/C as collateral to open second L/C for raw material supplier

---

### **7.1.4 Advantages of Letter of Credit**

**For Exporter (Beneficiary):**

✓ **Payment Guarantee:** Bank commitment ensures payment if documents comply
✓ **Reduced Credit Risk:** Doesn't depend on buyer's willingness to pay
✓ **Access to Finance:** Banks provide pre/post-shipment finance against L/C
✓ **Legal Protection:** Governed by international rules (UCP 600)
✓ **Cash Flow Management:** Can negotiate documents for immediate payment
✓ **Market Entry:** Enables trade with unknown buyers

**For Importer (Applicant):**

✓ **Payment Control:** Pays only when goods shipped (per documents)
✓ **Quality Assurance:** Can require inspection certificates
✓ **Delivery Assurance:** Documents prove shipment occurred
✓ **Credit Period:** Usance L/C provides payment deferment
✓ **Dispute Resolution:** Document requirements protect buyer interests

**For Banks:**

✓ **Fee Income:** Charges for L/C opening, advising, negotiation, confirmation
✓ **Controlled Risk:** Deal with documents, not goods
✓ **Security:** L/C backed by buyer's creditworthiness/collateral

---

### **7.1.5 Disadvantages and Limitations**

**Challenges:**

- **Cost:** L/C charges (0.5-2% of value) add to transaction cost
- **Complexity:** Requires expertise in documentation and UCP 600 rules
- **Strict Compliance:** Minor document discrepancies can delay/prevent payment
- **Time-Consuming:** L/C opening and document processing takes time
- **Bank Dependency:** Delays if banks are slow or inefficient
- **No Quality Guarantee:** Banks verify documents, not actual goods

---

## **7.2 Collecting Export L/C (Receiving L/C from Foreign Buyer)**

### **7.2.1 Pre-L/C: Sales Contract Negotiation**

Before L/C issuance, exporter and buyer agree on terms:

**Key Negotiation Points:**

1. **Payment Terms:** L/C at sight vs. usance
2. **L/C Type:** Irrevocable, confirmed (if high-risk country)
3. **Incoterm:** FOB, CFR, CIF
4. **Shipment Schedule:** Latest shipment date, partial shipments allowed?
5. **Document Requirements:** Certificates, inspection reports
6. **L/C Validity:** Expiry date, presentation period
7. **Banking Charges:** Who pays (applicant, beneficiary, or shared)

**Sales Contract/Proforma Invoice Issued:**
- Exporter sends proforma invoice with all terms
- Buyer approves and commits to open L/C

---

### **7.2.2 Step-by-Step L/C Collection Process**

#### **Step 1: Buyer Opens L/C with Issuing Bank**

**Buyer's Actions:**
```
Step 1.1: Approach bank with L/C application
Step 1.2: Provide documents:
    - Proforma invoice from exporter
    - Import permit (if required)
    - IRC (Import Registration Certificate)
    - Company documents
Step 1.3: Bank evaluates buyer's creditworthiness
Step 1.4: Buyer provides collateral/cash margin (typically 10-100% of L/C value)
Step 1.5: Bank opens L/C and issues to exporter via SWIFT
```

**Timeline:** 3-7 days depending on bank and buyer's credit status

---

#### **Step 2: L/C Transmitted to Advising Bank (Bangladesh)**

**SWIFT Transmission:**
- Issuing bank sends L/C via **SWIFT MT700** message
- Received by advising bank in Bangladesh (exporter's bank)
- Secure, encrypted communication

**Advising Bank's Actions:**
```
Step 2.1: Receive SWIFT message from issuing bank
Step 2.2: Verify authenticity (SWIFT key test codes)
Step 2.3: Check correspondent banking relationship with issuing bank
Step 2.4: Assess L/C terms and conditions
```

---

#### **Step 3: Advising Bank Notifies Exporter**

**Advising Process:**
- Bank calls/emails exporter: "Your L/C has arrived"
- Exporter visits bank to collect L/C copy
- Bank charges **advising fee** (BDT 2,000-5,000 or 0.1% of L/C value)

**L/C Document Contents:**
- **L/C Number:** Unique identifier (e.g., LC/2025/12345)
- **Date of Issue**
- **Applicant Details:** Buyer name, address
- **Beneficiary Details:** Exporter name, address (must match ERC exactly)
- **L/C Amount:** USD/EUR value
- **Expiry Date:** Last date for document presentation
- **Latest Shipment Date:** Goods must ship by this date
- **Incoterm:** FOB/CFR/CIF
- **Port of Loading:** Chittagong/Mongla Port
- **Port of Destination:** Final destination port
- **Description of Goods:** Detailed (HS Code, quantity, specifications)
- **Documents Required:** List of all documents needed for payment
- **Special Conditions:** Inspection, certification requirements
- **Payment Terms:** Sight or usance
- **Partial Shipments:** Allowed/Not Allowed
- **Transhipment:** Allowed/Not Allowed
- **Bank Charges:** Beneficiary's bank charges for beneficiary's account, or applicant's account

---

#### **Step 4: Exporter Examines L/C Carefully**

**Critical Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Port of loading correct (Chittagong/Mongla)
- [ ] Partial shipments clause acceptable
- [ ] Transhipment clause acceptable

**✓ Goods Description**
- [ ] Product description matches sales contract
- [ ] Quantity matches (or within acceptable tolerance, e.g., +/- 5%)
- [ ] Unit price and total value correct
- [ ] HS Code mentioned (if any) is correct

**✓ Document Requirements**
- [ ] All required documents can be obtained
- [ ] No impossible/conflicting requirements
- [ ] Inspection requirements feasible
- [ ] Certificate requirements clear

**✓ Payment Terms**
- [ ] Sight L/C or acceptable usance period
- [ ] Payment currency acceptable
- [ ] Bank charges allocation clear

**✓ Special Conditions**
- [ ] No contradictory clauses
- [ ] No ambiguous terms
- [ ] Compliance possible within timeframe

---

#### **Step 5: Request L/C Amendment (If Necessary)**

**If Discrepancies/Issues Found:**

**Common Amendment Requirements:**

| **Issue** | **Amendment Request** |
|----------|---------------------|
| Beneficiary name misspelled | Correct to match ERC exactly |
| Insufficient shipment time | Extend latest shipment date by 30 days |
| Impossible document requirement | Remove or modify requirement |
| Amount insufficient | Increase L/C value |
| Wrong port of loading | Change to Chittagong Port |
| Conflicting clauses | Clarify or remove conflicting condition |

**Amendment Process:**
```
Step 5.1: Exporter notifies advising bank of required amendments
Step 5.2: Advising bank contacts issuing bank via SWIFT
Step 5.3: Issuing bank requests buyer's consent
Step 5.4: Buyer approves/rejects amendment
Step 5.5: Amended L/C issued (new SWIFT MT707 message)
Step 5.6: Exporter reviews amended L/C
```

**Timeline:** 5-10 days for amendment

**Cost:** Amendment charges (USD 50-200) typically borne by buyer

**Important:** Do NOT ship goods until L/C is satisfactory. Shipping against non-compliant L/C risks non-payment.

---

#### **Step 6: Accept L/C and Proceed with Production**

Once L/C terms are acceptable:

```
Step 6.1: Exporter formally accepts L/C
Step 6.2: Inform buyer: "L/C acceptable, production starting"
Step 6.3: Apply for pre-shipment finance (if needed)
Step 6.4: Purchase raw materials
Step 6.5: Complete production
Step 6.6: Conduct quality inspection
Step 6.7: Prepare for shipment
```

---

### **7.2.3 Key L/C Terms and Clauses**

**A. Latest Shipment Date**
- **Meaning:** Last date by which goods must be loaded on vessel
- **Consequence:** Shipment after this date = document discrepancy = possible non-payment
- **Best Practice:** Build buffer; don't wait until last day

**B. Expiry Date**
- **Meaning:** Last date for presenting documents to bank
- **Typical Gap:** 21 days after latest shipment date (per UCP 600)
- **Consequence:** Late presentation = bank may refuse documents

**C. Partial Shipments**
- **"Allowed":** Can ship in multiple lots
- **"Not Allowed":** Must ship entire quantity in one shipment
- **Bangladesh Context:** RMG exporters often prefer "Allowed" for flexibility

**D. Transhipment**
- **"Allowed":** Goods can be transferred from one vessel to another during transit
- **"Not Allowed":** Direct vessel from loading port to destination (no transfers)
- **Impact:** "Not Allowed" may limit shipping line options

**E. Tolerance Clause**
- **Example:** "Quantity +/- 5% acceptable"
- **Purpose:** Allows minor variations in shipment quantity
- **UCP 600 Default:** 5% tolerance on quantity and amount (unless L/C says "approximately")

**F. Inspection Clause**
- **Example:** "Pre-shipment inspection by SGS mandatory"
- **Exporter Action:** Arrange inspection, obtain certificate, include in documents

**G. Bank Charges Clause**
- **"All bank charges outside Germany for applicant's account":** Buyer pays all charges except issuing bank's charges
- **"All bank charges for beneficiary's account":** Exporter pays ALL charges (rare, unfavorable)
- **"Each party bears own bank charges":** Split charges (common)

# **SECTION B: BACK-TO-BACK LETTER OF CREDIT**

## **7.4 Back-to-Back L/C - Critical for Bangladesh RMG Sector**

### **7.4.1 Understanding Back-to-Back L/C**

**Definition:** A Back-to-Back Letter of Credit is a second L/C opened by an exporter (beneficiary of the first L/C) using the buyer's original L/C (Master L/C) as collateral to purchase raw materials from a supplier.

**Alternative Names:**
- Countervailing Credit
- Subsidiary Credit
- Secondary L/C

**Why Essential for Bangladesh RMG:**
- Garment exporters receive L/Cs from international buyers
- Need to import fabric, accessories from suppliers (local/foreign)
- Often lack cash to pay suppliers upfront
- Back-to-Back L/C allows raw material procurement without cash outlay

### **7.4.3 Key Characteristics**

| **Aspect** | **Master L/C** | **Back-to-Back L/C** |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Opener** | Foreign buyer | Bangladesh exporter (using Master L/C) |
| **Beneficiary** | Bangladesh exporter | Fabric/accessory supplier |
| **Purpose** | Purchase finished goods (garments) | Purchase raw materials (fabric) |
| **Amount** | USD 100,000 (example) | USD 60,000 (60% of Master L/C) |
| **Shipment** | Chittagong to Hamburg | China to Chittagong (or local) |
| **Validity** | 90 days | Must expire before Master L/C expiry |
| **Security** | Buyer's creditworthiness | Master L/C (no additional collateral needed) |

---

### **7.4.4 Back-to-Back L/C Opening Process**

#### **Step 1: Receive Master L/C from Foreign Buyer**

```
Foreign buyer opens Master L/C
    ↓
Master L/C received by Bangladesh bank
    ↓
Bank advises exporter
    ↓
Exporter reviews and accepts Master L/C
```

---

#### **Step 2: Identify Raw Material Requirements**

**Exporter's Assessment:**
- Fabric required: 100,000 meters
- Cost: USD 1.50/meter = USD 150,000
- But Master L/C value: USD 100,000
- Issue: Need USD 60,000 for fabric (60% of order value)
- Solution: Open Back-to-Back L/C for USD 60,000

---

#### **Step 3: Submit Back-to-Back L/C Application to Bank**

**Required Documents:**

| **Document** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Master L/C (Original Copy)** | Primary security |
| **Back-to-Back L/C Application Form** | Bank's standard form |
| **Proforma Invoice from Supplier** | Details of raw materials to import |
| **Insurance Cover Note** | Marine insurance for fabric import |
| **Import Registration Certificate (IRC)** | Authorization to import |
| **Export Registration Certificate (ERC)** | Proof of exporter status |
| **Previous Export Performance Certificate** | Track record (for new relationships) |
| **Production Capacity Certificate** | Proof can manufacture the goods |

**Application Details Specified:**
- Supplier name and address (beneficiary of B2B L/C)
- Material description (fabric specifications)
- Quantity and unit price
- Total value (typically 60-90% of Master L/C value)
- Shipment terms (FOB, CIF)
- Latest shipment date (must be well before Master L/C shipment date)
- Documents required from supplier

---

#### **Step 4: Bank Evaluates Application**

**Bank's Assessment Criteria:**

✓ **Master L/C Quality**
- Issuing bank reputation (prime international bank preferred)
- L/C terms clear and achievable
- Irrevocable and confirmed (ideal)

✓ **Exporter's Credibility**
- Track record with bank
- Previous successful exports
- Production capacity
- Financial standing

✓ **Back-to-Back L/C Reasonableness**
- Value typically 60-90% of Master L/C (banks

 rarely allow 100%)
- Sufficient time gap between B2B shipment and Master L/C shipment
- Supplier reputation (known/reliable)

✓ **Risk Factors**
- Raw material delivery risk
- Production completion risk
- Quality risk

**Bank Decision:** Approve/Reject/Request Modifications

---

#### **Step 5: Terms and Conditions**

**Bank's Conditions for Back-to-Back L/C:**

**A. Amount Limit**
- Maximum 90% of Master L/C value (some banks: 80-85%)
- Balance 10-20% ensures exporter has margin to cover variations

**Example:**
```
Master L/C: USD 100,000
Maximum B2B L/C: USD 80,000-90,000
Exporter must finance remaining raw materials from own funds
```

**B. Shipment Schedule**
- B2B L/C latest shipment date must be at least 30-45 days BEFORE Master L/C shipment
- Allows time for:
  - Fabric arrival (15-20 days shipping)
  - Customs clearance (5-7 days)
  - Production (30-45 days)
  - Quality checks (2-3 days)
  - Export shipment

**Example:**
```
Master L/C Latest Shipment: August 31
Back-to-Back L/C Latest Shipment: July 15 (45 days earlier)
```

**C. Product Linkage**
- B2B L/C description must relate to Master L/C goods
- Example: Master L/C = Men's shirts; B2B L/C = Shirt fabric (valid)
- Cannot open B2B L/C for unrelated products

**D. Assignment of Proceeds**
- Exporter assigns Master L/C proceeds to bank
- Bank has first claim on Master L/C payment to recover B2B L/C payment
- Exporter receives balance after B2B settlement

**E. Document Substitution Rights**
- Bank may substitute its own commercial invoice for B2B documents
- Protects exporter's margin (supplier doesn't see final selling price)

---

#### **Step 6: Bank Opens Back-to-Back L/C**

**Process:**
```
Step 6.1: Bank approves application
Step 6.2: Exporter pays B2B L/C opening charges (0.25-0.5% of value)
Step 6.3: Bank issues B2B L/C via SWIFT to supplier's bank
Step 6.4: Supplier's bank advises supplier
Step 6.5: Supplier reviews and accepts B2B L/C
```

**Timeline:** 3-5 days from application to B2B L/C issuance

---

#### **Step 7: Supplier Ships Raw Materials**

```
Supplier manufactures/ships fabric
    ↓
Supplier clears export customs in their country
    ↓
Fabric shipped to Bangladesh (Chittagong Port)
    ↓
Supplier submits documents to their bank
    ↓
Supplier's bank examines documents
    ↓
Supplier receives payment (from B2B L/C)
```

---

#### **Step 8: Exporter Receives Raw Materials**

```
Fabric arrives at Chittagong Port
    ↓
Exporter clears import customs
    ↓
Uses fabric for production
    ↓
Produces finished garments as per Master L/C
```

---

#### **Step 9: Exporter Ships Finished Goods**

```
Production completed
    ↓
Quality inspection
    ↓
Export customs clearance
    ↓
Shipment to foreign buyer (Germany)
    ↓
Exporter submits documents under Master L/C
```

---

#### **Step 10: Payment Settlement**

**Payment Flow:**
```
Issuing Bank (Germany) pays USD 100,000 (Master L/C)
    ↓
Received by Bangladesh Bank
    ↓
Bank Deducts:
    - B2B L/C payment to supplier: USD 60,000
    - B2B L/C charges: USD 500
    - Master L/C charges: USD 1,000
    ↓
Net Amount Paid to Exporter: USD 38,500
```

**Exporter's Benefit:**
- Procured USD 60,000 worth of fabric without cash outlay
- Net earning: USD 38,500 (profit + overheads)

---

### **7.4.5 Advantages of Back-to-Back L/C**

**For Exporter:**

✓ **Zero Cash Outlay:** No need to pay suppliers upfront
✓ **Working Capital Relief:** Cash not tied up in raw materials
✓ **Supplier Confidence:** Suppliers receive bank guarantee (L/C)
✓ **Expand Business:** Can accept larger orders without capital constraints
✓ **Focus on Production:** Financial arrangements handled by bank

**For Supplier:**

✓ **Payment Security:** Bank-backed payment guarantee
✓ **Risk Mitigation:** Don't depend on exporter's creditworthiness
✓ **Timely Payment:** L/C ensures payment upon document presentation

**For Bank:**

✓ **Low Risk:** Master L/C serves as collateral
✓ **Fee Income:** Charges for opening, amendment, negotiation
✓ **Client Relationship:** Supports exporter growth

---

### **7.4.6 Challenges and Limitations**

**Potential Issues:**

**A. Tight Timelines**
- If fabric shipment delays, exporter cannot meet Master L/C shipment deadline
- Risk: Loss of Master L/C payment

**B. Amount Limitations**
- Bank allows only 80-90% of Master L/C value
- Exporter must self-finance remaining 10-20% raw material cost

**C. Document Discrepancies**
- If supplier's documents are discrepant, payment delayed
- Affects exporter's production schedule

**D. Price Volatility**
- If raw material prices increase after B2B L/C opened, exporter bears extra cost
- Master L/C price is fixed

**E. Bank Dependency**
- Entire process depends on bank approval and efficiency
- Bank delays can derail the transaction

---

### **7.4.7 Practical Example (Bangladesh RMG Context)**

**Scenario:**

**Step 9:** Documents submitted under Master L/C on October 30

**Step 10:** Payment received November 10

**Financial Settlement:**
```
Master L/C Payment Received: USD 150,000
Less: B2B L/C payment (fabric): USD 75,000
Less: Buttons/labels (self-financed): USD 10,000
Less: Production cost: USD 35,000

1. **Receipt** for goods
2. **Contract** of carriage
3. **Document of Title** (ownership transferable)

**Types of Bill of Lading:**

#### **A. Based on Receipt of Goods**

**1. Shipped on Board B/L (Onboard B/L)**
- Confirms goods actually loaded on vessel
- **Most preferred** by banks and buyers
- Required for most L/Cs

**2. Received for Shipment B/L**
- Goods received by shipping line but not yet loaded
- Lower certainty for buyer
- Banks often reject unless endorsed "Shipped on Board"

---

#### **B. Based on Condition of Goods**

**1. Clean B/L**
- No remarks about damage/defect
- Goods received in "apparent good order and condition"
- **Essential for L/C payment**
- Banks reject claused/dirty B/L

**2. Claused/Foul B/L**
- Contains remarks: "damaged packaging," "rust stains," etc.
- Indicates defects
- **Unacceptable** for L/C transactions

---

#### **C. Based on Transferability**

**1. Negotiable B/L (To Order B/L)**

- Transferable by endorsement
- Most common in L/C transactions

**Format:** 
```
Consignee: To Order of Deutsche Bank, Germany

```

**2. Non-Negotiable B/L (Straight B/L)**
- Consigned directly to a named party
- Cannot be transferred
- Less common in international trade

---

#### **D. Based on Routing**

**1. Direct B/L**
- Direct shipment from origin to destination (no transhipment)
- Preferred; lower risk of damage/loss

**2. Through B/L**
- Covers transhipment (goods transferred to another vessel)
- Common when no direct service available

**Example:** Chittagong → Singapore (transhipment) → Hamburg

| **Late Shipment** | B/L date: September 5; L/C latest shipment: August 31 |
| **Expired L/C** | Documents presented October 10; L/C expiry: October 5 |
| **Inconsistent Dates** | Invoice date before L/C date (impossible) |

---

#### **B. Description Discrepancies**

| **Discrepancy** | **L/C Description** | **Document Description** |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Product mismatch** | "Men's Cotton T-Shirts" | "Men's T-Shirts" (missing "Cotton") |
| **Quantity variance** | "10,000 pieces +/- 5%" | Shipped: 11,000 pieces (exceeds tolerance) |
| **HS Code error** | "6109.10.00" | "6109.90.00" |

**Rule:** Description in invoices must match L/C **exactly**. Other documents (B/L, packing list) may use general terms.

---

#### **C. Amount Discrepancies**

| **Discrepancy** | **Issue** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Over-drawing** | Invoice value USD 105,000; L/C amount USD 100,000 |
| **Under-drawing without explanation** | Invoice USD 90,000; L/C USD 100,000 (may be acceptable if within tolerance) |
| **Inconsistent amounts** | Invoice: USD 100,000; Insurance: USD 95,000 (insurance should be 110% of invoice) |

---

#### **D. Document Missing or Incomplete**

| **Discrepancy** | **Issue** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Missing document** | L/C requires inspection certificate; not presented |
| **Incomplete B/L set** | Presented 2 originals; B/L states "3/3 originals" |
| **Unsigned document** | Commercial invoice not signed by authorized signatory |
| **Missing stamp/seal** | Certificate of Origin not stamped by issuing authority |

---

#### **E. B/L Discrepancies**

| **Discrepancy** | **Issue** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Claused B/L** | B/L contains remarks: "Packaging damaged" |
| **Wrong consignee** | Consigned to buyer directly; L/C requires "To Order of Bank" |
| **Transhipment not allowed** | B/L shows transhipment; L/C prohibits transhipment |
| **Late B/L date** | B/L dated after L/C latest shipment date |
| **On Board notation missing** | B/L is "Received for Shipment"; L/C requires "Shipped on Board" |

---

#### **F. Other Common Discrepancies**

- **Spelling errors:** Exporter name: "XYZ Apparels Ltd." vs. L/C: "XYZ Apparel Ltd."
- **Inconsistent data:** Gross weight in invoice: 10,000 kg; in packing list: 10,500 kg
- **Wrong port:** Port of loading: Mongla; L/C specifies Chittagong
- **Certification issues:** Certificate issued after B/L date (certificate should be before/same date)

---

### **7.10.3 Consequences of Discrepancies**

**Bank's Options (UCP 600 Article 16):**

**Option 1: Refuse Documents**
- Bank rejects documents
- Exporter does not receive payment
- Documents returned to exporter
- Bank charges refusal fee

**Option 2: Hold Documents and Seek Applicant's Waiver**
- Bank contacts issuing bank/buyer
- Explains discrepancies
- Asks if buyer will accept despite discrepancies
- **Most common approach**

**Possible Outcomes:**
```
Buyer Accepts Discrepancies → Bank Pays Exporter
    ↓
OR
    ↓
Buyer Rejects → Documents Returned, No Payment
```

---

### **7.10.4 Exporter's Steps When Discrepancies Occur**

#### **Step 1: Receive Discrepancy Notice from Bank**

Bank sends notice listing all discrepancies found

**Example Notice:**
```
DISCREPANCY NOTICE

L/C No.: LC123456
Date: November 5, 2025

The following discrepancies have been noted in the documents presented:

1. Late presentation: Documents presented 23 days after B/L date; 
   L/C allows 21 days.

2. Description mismatch: Invoice states "Cotton T-Shirts"; L/C requires 
   "100% Cotton T-Shirts."

3. Missing document: Inspection certificate required by L/C not presented.

Please advise your instructions.
```

---

#### **Step 2: Assess Severity of Discrepancies**

**Minor Discrepancies (Likely Waivable):**
- Small typographical errors
- Non-material description differences
- Minor date issues (1-2 days late presentation)

**Major Discrepancies (Less Likely Waivable):**
- Late shipment (beyond latest shipment date)
- Significant product description mismatch
- Missing critical documents
- Claused B/L

---

#### **Step 3: Contact Buyer Immediately**

**Proactive Communication:**
```
Email/Call Buyer:

"Dear [Buyer Name],

We have shipped your order as agreed. However, the bank has noted 
the following discrepancies in the documents:

[List discrepancies]

We kindly request you instruct your bank to accept the documents 
despite these discrepancies. The goods are exactly as ordered and 
in good condition.

Please confirm your acceptance at the earliest.

Best regards,
[Your Name]"
```

---

#### **Step 4: Provide Explanation/Evidence**

**If Discrepancy is Disputable:**
- Provide supporting documents
- Explain why document is compliant

**Example:**
```
Discrepancy: "Description does not match L/C."
L/C states: "Men's Cotton T-Shirts, 100% Cotton"
Invoice states: "Men's T-Shirts, Cotton"

Exporter's Argument:
"The invoice clearly states 'Cotton' which means 100% cotton. 
This is a standard interpretation in the textile industry."
```

**Bank May:**
- Accept explanation
- Or still consider it discrepant and seek buyer's waiver

---

#### **Step 5: Buyer Accepts Discrepancies**

**Best Scenario:**
```
Buyer instructs issuing bank: "Accept documents despite discrepancies."
    ↓
Issuing bank instructs negotiating bank: "Pay beneficiary."
    ↓
Exporter receives payment
    ↓
May include discrepancy handling charges (USD 50-100)
```

---

#### **Step 6: Buyer Rejects / Does Not Respond**

**Worst Scenario:**

**Exporter's Options:**

**Option A: Amend Documents (if possible)**
- If missing document, obtain and resubmit
- If error in document, get corrected version
- Resubmit to bank

**Challenge:** Often impossible (e.g., B/L already issued, shipment already occurred)

---

**Option B: Accept Discrepancy Charges and Try Again**
- Some banks allow resubmission
- Exporter pays additional charges

---

**Option C: Send Documents on Collection Basis**
- Bank sends documents to buyer directly (not under L/C)
- Buyer inspects documents and goods
- If satisfied, pays exporter
- **Risk:** No payment guarantee (buyer might refuse)

---

**Option D: Negotiate Directly with Buyer**
- Offer price discount in exchange for accepting documents
- Common practice: 2-5% discount to resolve discrepancy

**Example:**
```
Original Invoice: USD 100,000
Offer to Buyer: "Accept documents, we'll discount 3%."
Revised Amount: USD 97,000
```

---

**Option E: Legal Action (Last Resort)**
- If buyer refuses despite valid claim
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Rarely pursued for small discrepancies

---

### **7.10.5 Preventing Discrepancies - Best Practices**

**BEFORE Shipment:**

✓ **Review L/C Thoroughly Upon Receipt**
- Identify potential compliance issues early
- Request amendments if needed

✓ **Create Document Checklist**
- Based on L/C requirements
- Assign responsibility for each document

✓ **Pre-Ship Document Dry Run**

- Copy-paste product description from L/C to invoice
- Don't paraphrase or abbreviate

✓ **Date Management**
- Ensure all dates logical and sequential
- No document dated before L/C date
- Certificates dated before/same as B/L date

✓ **Triple-Check Numbers**
- Quantities, weights, values
- Ensure consistency across all documents

✓ **Professional Preparation**
- Use templates
- Avoid handwritten corrections (or authenticate properly)
- Clear, legible printing

**AFTER Documentation:**

✓ **Self-Audit Before Bank Submission**
- Review all documents against L/C point-by-point

- Allows time for correction if issues found

✓ **Maintain Communication**
- Keep buyer informed of shipment status
- Alert buyer if potential discrepancy foreseen

### **7.10.6 Bangladesh-Specific Discrepancy Issues**

**Common Issues for Bangladeshi Exporters:**

**1. EXP Form Stamp Issues**
- Customs stamp unclear or missing
- **Solution:** Check stamp visibility before leaving customs

**2. GSP Certificate Delays**
- EPB processing delays cause certificate date after B/L date
- **Solution:** Apply to EPB 5-7 days before shipment

**3. Spelling Variations**
- Company name in ERC: "ABC Textiles Ltd."
- Invoice: "ABC Textile Limited"
- **Solution:** Use exact name as in ERC across all documents

**4. Bank Charges Clause Confusion**
- Exporter unsure whether to mention "bank charges for beneficiary's account" in documents
- **Solution:** Clearly state as per L/C terms

Bank sends documents to Issuing Bank (Germany)
    ↓
Bank Credits Exporter's Account (Post-Shipment Finance / Immediate Payment)
    ↓
Awaits Reimbursement from Issuing Bank (5-7 days)

    │
    └─→ Waiver Refused → Documents Returned OR Sent on Collection Basis
```

---

### **7.11.5 Payment Timeline**

**For Sight L/C (Clean Documents):**

| **Stage** | **Timeline** |
|----------|-------------|
| Document submission to negotiating bank (Bangladesh) | Day 0 |
| Bank examination | Day 0-5 |
| Negotiation and advance payment to exporter | Day 5-7 |
| Documents sent to issuing bank (Germany) | Day 7 |
| Issuing bank examination | Day 8-12 |
| Issuing bank pays negotiating bank | Day 13-15 |
| **Final settlement** | Day 15 |

**Total:** ~15 days from document submission to final payment (if no discrepancies)

**For Usance L/C (e.g., 90 Days After Sight):**

- Add 90 days to above timeline
- **Total:** ~105 days from document submission

**Exporter Option:** Discount usance documents with bank for immediate payment (bank charges discount fee)

---

### **7.11.6 Bank Charges Deducted**

**Typical Charges (Bangladesh Context):**

| **Charge** | **Amount** | **Borne By** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Advising Charges** | BDT 2,000-5,000 OR 0.1% of L/C value | Exporter (usually) |
| **Negotiation Charges** | 0.20-0.30% of invoice value | Exporter |
| **SWIFT Charges** | BDT 2,000-3,000 per message | As per L/C clause |
| **Document Handling Fee** | BDT 1,000-2,000 | Exporter |
| **Courier Charges** | BDT 3,000-5,000 (if documents couriered to issuing bank) | As per L/C clause |
| **Discrepancy Charges** | USD 50-100 (if discrepancies waived) | Exporter |
| **Confirmation Charges** | 0.5-2% of L/C value (if L/C confirmed) | Negotiable |

**Example Calculation:**
```
Invoice Value: USD 100,000
Negotiation Charges (0.25%): USD 250
SWIFT Charges: USD 30
Document Handling: USD 20
Total Deductions: USD 300

Net Amount to Exporter: USD 99,700
```

---

### **7.11.7 Alternative Payment Claiming (Non-L/C)**

**If Export NOT Under L/C:**

**A. Documents Against Payment (D/P)**
```
Exporter ships goods
    ↓
Submits documents to bank
    ↓
Bank sends documents to buyer's bank
    ↓
Buyer pays bank to receive documents
    ↓
Buyer's bank remits payment to exporter's bank
    ↓
Exporter receives payment
```

**Risk:** Higher than L/C (no bank payment guarantee)

---

**B. Documents Against Acceptance (D/A)**
```
Similar to D/P, but:
    ↓
Buyer "accepts" a time draft (e.g., 60 days)
    ↓
Receives documents immediately
    ↓
Pays after 60 days
```

**Risk:** Very high (buyer may default after receiving goods)

---

**C. Open Account / Advance Payment**
```
ADVANCE: Buyer pays before shipment (low risk for exporter)
OPEN ACCOUNT: Exporter ships first, buyer pays later (high risk)
```

**Not Recommended:** Unless strong buyer relationship and trust

---

## **7.12 Chapter Summary**

Export-import documentation is a complex but critical process ensuring secure, compliant, and efficient international trade. Key takeaways:

✓ **Letter of Credit (L/C):** Bank-backed payment guarantee; most secure payment method; governed by UCP 600 rules

✓ **Back-to-Back L/C:** Essential for Bangladesh RMG exporters; enables raw material procurement without cash outlay using Master L/C as collateral

✓ **Three Document Categories:** Transportation (B/L, AWB), Customs (Invoices, Certificates), Facilitating (PO, LOI)

✓ **Discrepancy Management:** Minor errors can delay/prevent payment; prevention through meticulous preparation; buyer waiver often resolves issues

✓ **Payment Claiming:** Complete, accurate document set submitted to bank; examination within 5 days; clean documents lead to payment; discrepant documents require resolution

✓ **Professional Excellence:** Success in export business requires mastery of documentation alongside product quality and pricing
