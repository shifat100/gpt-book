## 9.1 Introduction

Export order processing is the systematic execution of export transactions from order confirmation to final payment realization. In Bangladesh, where exports constitute a significant portion of GDP (approximately 15-18%), efficient order processing is critical for exporters' success and the nation's economic growth.

This chapter focuses on the final execution stages of export orders, covering regulatory compliance, documentation, payment procedures, risk management, and the crucial role of financial institutions. Understanding these processes is essential for BBA students preparing for careers in international trade.

**The Export Order Processing Cycle:**

```
ORDER RECEIPT → ORDER CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION/PROCUREMENT → 
PRE-SHIPMENT INSPECTION → PRE-DESPATCH PROCEDURES → 
SHIPMENT & DOCUMENTATION → POST-DESPATCH PROCEDURES → 
PAYMENT REALIZATION → AFTER-SALES SERVICE
```

This chapter concentrates on the highlighted stages: pre-despatch, post-despatch, and payment realization.

## 9.2 Pre-Despatch Procedures

Pre-despatch procedures involve all regulatory clearances and preparations required before goods can be shipped from Bangladesh. These procedures ensure compliance with domestic laws and facilitate smooth customs clearance.

### 9.2.1 Overview of Pre-Despatch Requirements

Before exporting goods from Bangladesh, exporters must:

1. Obtain necessary regulatory clearances
2. Complete excise formalities (where applicable)
3. Secure VAT/sales tax clearance
4. Prepare export documents
5. Arrange inspection (if required)
6. Book shipping space
7. Arrange insurance
8. Complete packaging and labeling

**Bangladesh Legal Framework:**

- Customs Act, 1969
- Import and Export (Control) Act, 1950
- Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012
- National Board of Revenue (NBR) regulations
- Bangladesh Bank guidelines

### 9.2.2 Excise Clearance of Export Goods

**Note on Bangladesh Context:**

While "excise duty" traditionally refers to duties on domestically produced goods, Bangladesh has largely replaced excise duties with VAT under the VAT and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012. However, understanding the general excise clearance procedure remains relevant for:

- Certain specific products still subject to supplementary duty
- Historical context
- Understanding procedures in other countries
- Conceptual knowledge for trade professionals

#### **General Procedure for Excise Clearance (Where Applicable)**

**Step 1: Manufacturing under Bond (if applicable)**

Some exporters operate under bonded warehouse facilities to manufacture goods duty-free for export.

**Bonded Warehouse Benefits:**
- Import raw materials without paying customs duty
- Import capital machinery duty-free
- Manufacture goods for export
- Pay duties only if goods sold domestically

**Types in Bangladesh:**
- Private Bonded Warehouses (owned by exporters)
- Public Bonded Warehouses (shared facilities)
- Special Economic Zones (SEZ) with bonded status

**Process:**
1. Apply to NBR Customs for bonded status
2. Provide bank guarantee
3. Maintain detailed records of inputs and outputs
4. Regular audit by customs authorities
5. Annual renewal of bond license

**Step 2: Application for Excise Clearance**

When goods are ready for export:

**Documents Required:**
- Application for removal (ARE-1 form)
- Commercial invoice
- Packing list
- Bill of export
- Transport documents
- Export contract/purchase order
- Letter of credit (if applicable)

**Submission:**
- Submit to concerned excise/customs office
- Electronic submission through ASYCUDA World (Bangladesh)
- Physical verification if required

**Step 3: Examination and Verification**

**Customs Examination:**
- Physical inspection of goods (selective or comprehensive)
- Verification of quantity and description
- Assessment of value
- Checking compliance with export regulations

**Documentation Check:**
- Verify all documents are complete and accurate
- Cross-check with license/registration
- Ensure consistency across documents

**Step 4: Payment of Duties (if any)**

For goods meant for domestic market that are being diverted to export, or for short clearances:

- Calculate applicable duties
- Make payment through authorized channels
- Obtain duty payment receipt

**Note:** Export goods are generally exempt from duties, but proper clearance is required.

**Step 5: Grant of Clearance**

Upon satisfaction:
- Excise clearance certificate issued
- Electronic clearance recorded in system
- Goods allowed for movement to port
- Seal affixed if required

**Step 6: Movement to Port**

**Transit Procedures:**
- Obtain gate pass or transit permit
- Vehicle registration with customs
- Electronic tracking (where implemented)
- Delivery at designated customs area at port

**Documents Accompanying Goods:**
- Excise clearance certificate
- Commercial invoice
- Packing list
- Transport document
- Gate pass

#### **Special Considerations for Bangladesh**

**Export Processing Zones (EPZ):**
- Located in Dhaka, Chittagong, Mongla, Ishwardi, etc.
- Duty-free zone for export-oriented industries
- Separate customs procedures
- Administered by Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA)

**Duty Drawback Scheme:**
- Refund of duties paid on imported inputs used in exported goods
- Available for non-bonded manufacturers
- Claim after export with supporting documents
- Time-consuming process but valuable benefit

**Special Bonded Warehouses:**
- RMG sector extensively uses bonded facilities
- Simplified procedures for registered exporters
- Regular compliance monitoring

### 9.2.3 VAT/Sales Tax Clearance for Exports

In Bangladesh, exports are generally zero-rated for VAT purposes, meaning exporters don't charge VAT on export sales but can claim refunds on VAT paid on inputs.

#### **VAT Framework for Exports in Bangladesh**

**Legal Basis:**
- Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012
- VAT Rules, 2016
- Relevant NBR circulars and SROs (Statutory Regulatory Orders)

**Zero-Rating Principle:**
- Export sales are zero-rated (0% VAT)
- Exporters can claim input VAT refund
- No VAT liability on export transactions
- Supports export competitiveness

#### **Procedure for VAT Clearance**

**Step 1: VAT Registration**

**Requirement:**
- All exporters must be VAT registered
- Obtain VAT registration certificate from NBR
- 15-digit BIN (Business Identification Number)

**Documents for Registration:**
- Trade license
- ERC (Export Registration Certificate)
- Bank account details
- Factory/office address proof
- National ID of proprietor/directors
- Memorandum of Association (for companies)

**Step 2: Maintain VAT Records**

**Record Keeping Requirements:**
- Issue tax invoices (for domestic sales)
- Maintain purchase records with VAT invoices
- Keep separate records for export sales
- Prepare monthly VAT accounts
- Maintain books for minimum 5 years

**Documentation:**
- Purchase register

**Step 3: Monthly VAT Return Filing**

**Filing Obligation:**
- File monthly VAT return (Mushak 9.1)
- Submit by 15th of following month
- Electronic filing through NBR online system
- Pay net VAT liability (if any)

**For Exporters:**
- Show export sales as zero-rated
- Claim input VAT credit
- Net position typically refund due (excess credit)

**Step 4: VAT Clearance Certificate for Export Shipment**

**When Required:**
- Some export consignments require VAT clearance
- Particularly for high-value shipments
- Part of customs clearance process

**Procedure:**
1. Submit application to VAT office
2. Provide export documents:
   - Commercial invoice
   - Packing list
   - Export LC or contract
   - EXP form (customs declaration)
3. VAT officer verification
4. Issue VAT clearance certificate

**Electronic Process:**
- Integrated with ASYCUDA World system
- Automated clearance for compliant exporters
- Faster processing for green channel exporters

**Step 5: Input VAT Refund Claim**

Since exports are zero-rated, exporters accumulate input VAT credits.

**Claiming Refund:**

**Documents Required:**
- VAT refund application (Mushak 11.5)
- Export documents (Bill of Lading, invoice, EXP form)
- Bank certificate of proceeds realization
- Purchase invoices showing input VAT
- Monthly VAT returns for the period
- Treasury challan (if any VAT paid)

**Process:**
1. File refund claim with jurisdictional VAT office
2. Audit by VAT authorities (often required)
3. Field verification (may be conducted)
4. Approval by competent authority
5. Refund through pay order or direct bank credit

**Timeline:**
- Legally should be processed within specific timeframe
- In practice, can take several months
- Fast-track for compliant exporters

**Alternative - Adjustment:**
- Instead of refund, can adjust against future VAT liability
- Useful if exporter also has domestic sales
- Carry forward excess credit

#### **Special VAT Facilities for Exporters**

**1. VAT at Import Stage (on Raw Materials)**

**For Bonded Warehouse Holders:**
- Import raw materials without paying VAT
- Exemption under bonded warehouse provisions

**If Discrepancies Found:**

**Option A - Correct the Discrepancies:**
- If minor and correctable (e.g., missing signature)
- Obtain corrected document
- Resubmit to bank

**Option B - Accept Discrepancies:**
- Proceed with discrepant documents
- Bank will negotiate "under reserve"
- Payment subject to buyer's/issuing bank's acceptance
- Risk of refusal or deduction

**Option C - Contact Buyer:**
- Seek buyer's approval for discrepancies
- Obtain waiver/acceptance in writing
- Bank may accept based on buyer's consent

**Option D - Wait and Re-export:**
- If goods haven't reached destination
- Request shipping line to return cargo
- Correct issues and re-ship
- Expensive option

**Common Discrepancies:**
- Late presentation
- Description discrepancy
- Amount exceeded
- Document date issues
- Missing document
- Inconsistencies between documents

**Discrepancy Charges:**
- Issuing bank may charge USD 50-150 for discrepant presentation
- May be deducted from payment
- Negotiable if buyer accepts discrepancies

**Step 5: Negotiation and Payment**

**If Documents are Compliant (or Accepted):**

**Negotiation:**
- Bank "purchases" the documents
- Provides immediate payment to exporter (minus charges)
- Sends documents to issuing bank for reimbursement

**Payment Options:**

**a) Advance Payment (Negotiation at Sight):**
- Bank pays exporter immediately
- At face value minus:
  - Bank charges/commission
  - Courier/SWIFT charges
  - Discrepancy fees (if any)
- Exporter receives funds in 1-2 days

**b) Payment After Acceptance:**
- For usance (deferred payment) L/Cs
- Bank may provide discount facility
- Pay exporter now, collect from issuing bank later
- Discount charges apply

**Bank Charges (Typical in Bangladesh):**
- Negotiation commission: 0.25% - 0.5% of invoice value
- SWIFT charges: BDT 1,500 - 3,000
- Courier charges: BDT 3,000 - 5,000
- Postage: BDT 500 - 1,000
- Discrepancy fee: USD 50 - 150 (if applicable)
- Other incidental charges

**Step 6: Document Dispatch to Issuing Bank**

**Bank's Action:**
- Send documents by courier (DHL, FedEx) to issuing bank
- Or through banking channels (SWIFT)
- Include covering letter
- Request reimbursement

**Timeline:**
- Documents reach issuing bank in 2-5 days
- Issuing bank examines documents
- If accepted, reimburses negotiating bank
- Process complete

**Step 7: Reimbursement to Negotiating Bank**

**From Issuing Bank:**
- Issuing bank pays negotiating bank
- Through reimbursement bank (if specified)
- Usually within 5-7 days of acceptance

**Exporter's Position:**
- Already received payment from negotiating bank
- Transaction complete from exporter's perspective
- Risk transferred to banks

#### **Documents Against Payment (D/P) Collection**

For non-L/C transactions where buyer pays upon presentation.

**Process:**

1. Exporter ships goods
2. Submits documents to remitting bank (exporter's bank)
3. Remitting bank sends documents to collecting bank (buyer's bank) with instructions
4. Collecting bank presents documents to buyer
5. Buyer pays collecting bank
6. Collecting bank remits payment to remitting bank
7. Remitting bank credits exporter's account

**Instructions:** "Documents against Payment" - release documents only upon payment

**Risk:** Higher than L/C (buyer may refuse)

**Timeline:** Longer (15-30 days typically)

#### **Documents Against Acceptance (D/A) Collection**

Similar to D/P but buyer accepts a bill of exchange (time draft) instead of immediate payment.

**Process:**

1. Documents sent with term bill of exchange (e.g., 90 days)
2. Buyer accepts the bill
3. Documents released to buyer
4. Buyer pays on due date

**Risk:** Very high (buyer gets goods on promise to pay later)

**Use:** Only with highly trusted buyers

#### **Negotiation Timeline (Typical for Bangladesh L/C Exports)**

| **Activity** | **Timeline** | **Responsibility** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Goods shipped | Day 0 | Exporter |
| Documents collected | Days 1-3 | Exporter/Freight Forwarder |
| Documents submitted to bank | Day 3-5 | Exporter |
| Bank scrutiny | Days 5-8 | Negotiating Bank |
| Negotiation (if clean) | Day 8 | Negotiating Bank |
| Payment to exporter | Days 8-10 | Negotiating Bank |
| Documents reach issuing bank | Days 10-15 | Courier |
| Issuing bank examination | Days 15-18 | Issuing Bank |
| Reimbursement | Days 18-25 | Issuing Bank |

**Note:** This is for sight L/C. Usance L/Cs add the credit period to the timeline.

### 9.3.5 Handling Problems with Documents

Despite careful preparation, problems can arise. Here's how to handle common issues:

#### **Problem 1: Missing Original Document**

**Scenario:** Lost original B/L or certificate

**Solutions:**
- **For B/L:** Contact shipping line for duplicate original (letter of indemnity + bank guarantee required)
- **For Certificate of Origin:** Apply for duplicate from issuing authority
- **For Insurance:** Contact insurance company for duplicate
- **Timeline Impact:** May cause late presentation

#### **Problem 2: Late Shipment**

**Scenario:** Goods shipped after L/C expiry or latest shipment date

**Solutions:**
- **Option A:** Contact buyer immediately for L/C amendment (extension)
- **Option B:** Negotiate under reserve with buyer's acceptance
- **Option C:** Ship at own risk and seek buyer's waiver
- **Prevention:** Monitor L/C dates closely, maintain shipping schedule buffer

#### **Problem 3: Description Discrepancy**

**Scenario:** Product description in documents doesn't match L/C exactly

**Solutions:**
- **Minor Variation:** Negotiate with buyer's pre-approval
- **Major Variation:** May require L/C amendment before shipment (but too late if shipped)
- **Bank Approach:** Present with covering letter explaining and requesting waiver
- **Prevention:** Copy L/C wording verbatim in all documents

#### **Problem 4: Amount Exceeded**

**Scenario:** Invoice amount exceeds L/C value due to quantity variation or price calculation error

**Solutions:**
- **If within tolerance (usually +5%):** May be acceptable per UCP 600 rules
- **If beyond tolerance:** 
  - Option A: Reduce invoice to L/C limit (absorb difference)
  - Option B: Request L/C amendment for increased value
  - Option C: Negotiate discrepancy with buyer's acceptance
- **Prevention:** Calculate carefully, check L/C credit available before finalizing invoice

#### **Problem 5: Document Not Available in Time**

**Scenario:** Inspection certificate or other required document delayed

**Solutions:**
- **Coordinate urgently:** Follow up with issuing agency
- **Express service:** Pay for urgent processing
- **Alternative:** If permissible, submit other documents first, add missing one via amendment
- **Notify bank and buyer:** Communicate delay immediately
- **Prevention:** Apply for certificates well in advance

#### **Problem 6: Refused Shipment/Return**

**Scenario:** Buyer refuses to accept goods or payment due to serious discrepancies

**Solutions:**
- **Negotiation:** Try to resolve with buyer (price reduction, replacement, etc.)
- **Re-export:** Ship to alternative buyer (if possible)
- **Store at destination:** Arrange warehousing while resolving
- **Legal action:** If buyer breaching contract
- **Insurance claim:** If covered under credit insurance
- **Last resort:** Abandon cargo or sell at distress prices

#### **Problem 7: Delayed Payment from Issuing Bank**

**Scenario:** Reimbursement to negotiating bank delayed

**Exporter's Position:**
- Usually not directly affected (already paid by negotiating bank)
- However, in "with recourse" negotiation, exporter may be liable

**Bank's Action:**
- Follow up with issuing bank
- Send reminder SWIFT messages
- Escalate through correspondent banks
- Legal action (rare)

**Exporter's Action:**
- Stay informed from bank
- Maintain communication with buyer
- For future, avoid problematic issuing banks

#### **Problem 8: Issuing Bank Refuses Payment**

**Scenario:** Issuing bank refuses to honor L/C due to discrepancies or other reasons

**Implications:**

**For "With Recourse" Negotiation:**
- Negotiating bank can demand refund from exporter
- Exporter must return payment received
- Exporter directly faces the loss

**For "Without Recourse" Negotiation:**
- Negotiating bank bears the risk
- Exporter keeps payment
- Requires higher charges and strong exporter relationship

**Actions:**
- **Review Discrepancies:** Understand exact reasons for refusal
- **Contact Buyer:** Seek buyer's intervention with issuing bank
- **Negotiate Settlement:** May accept reduced payment
- **Legal Action:** Against buyer (L/C is independent but underlying contract exists)
- **Insurance Claim:** If covered under export credit insurance

**Prevention:**
- Deal with reputable issuing banks
- Ensure strict L/C compliance
- Obtain buyer's pre-approval for any discrepancies
- Use confirmed L/Cs for high-risk situations

## 9.4 Payment Realization

Payment realization is the final and most critical stage where the exporter receives the sale proceeds in foreign currency.

### 9.4.1 Concept of Payment Realization

**Payment Realization** refers to the process of receiving export proceeds in freely convertible foreign currency and converting them (if desired) into local currency (BDT).

**Bangladesh Context:**

**Legal Requirements:**
- All export proceeds must be realized within stipulated time (typically 4 months from shipment date)
- Proceeds must be repatriated to Bangladesh
- Must be received through authorized dealer banks
- Compliance monitored by Bangladesh Bank

**Regulations:**
- Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947
- Bangladesh Bank circulars
- Export Policy of Bangladesh
- Money Laundering Prevention Act

### 9.4.2 Process of Payment Realization

#### **Step 1: Receipt of Proceeds in Foreign Currency**

**Through Negotiating Bank:**
- For L/C transactions: Payment received from issuing bank
- For D/P/D/A: Payment received from collecting bank
- For advance payment: Direct remittance from buyer

**Credit to Exporter's Account:**
- Foreign currency credited to exporter's Foreign Currency (FC) Account or
- Automatically converted to BDT at prevailing exchange rate

#### **Step 2: Foreign Currency Account Options**

Bangladesh exporters have options for handling foreign currency proceeds:

**Option A: Immediate Conversion**
- Convert foreign currency to BDT immediately
- At bank's TT (Telegraphic Transfer) buying rate
- Funds available in BDT account same day

**Option B: Retention in Foreign Currency Account (FC Account / ERQ Account)**

**Export Retention Quota (ERQ) / FC Account:**
- Exporters can retain up to 7.5% of realized export proceeds in foreign currency account
- Can be held in USD, EUR, GBP, or JPY
- Use for:
  - Payment of import bills (raw materials, machinery)
  - Foreign travel expenses
  - Commission payments to foreign agents
  - Other approved purposes

**Benefits:**
- Hedge against exchange rate fluctuations
- Convenient for regular importers
- Avoids conversion costs

**Limitations:**
- Cannot exceed 7.5% retention limit
- Must be used for permitted purposes
- Subject to Bangladesh Bank regulations

#### **Step 3: Exchange Control Compliance**

**Export Proceeds Certificate (EPC):**
- Bank issues EPC after realization of export proceeds
- States amount realized and date
- Required for various purposes:
  - VAT refund claims
  - Export subsidy/incentive claims
  - Renewing ERC
  - Future L/C openings

**EXP Form Submission:**
- Exporter submits EXP form copy to bank
- Bank certifies proceeds realized
- Forwarded to Bangladesh Bank
- Part of export monitoring system

**Reporting to Bangladesh Bank:**
- Banks report all export proceeds to Bangladesh Bank
- Electronic reporting system
- Helps monitor export earnings
- Tracks outstanding export bills

#### **Step 4: Incentives and Benefits Claim**

After payment realization, exporters can claim various incentives:

**Cash Incentives:**
- Government provides cash incentives for certain sectors
- Rates vary (e.g., 4% for RMG, higher for others)
- Applied through bank
- Credited to exporter's account

**Procedure:**
1. Submit application to bank
2. Attach documents (EXP form, EPC, invoice, etc.)
3. Bank verifies and forwards to Bangladesh Bank
4. Bangladesh Bank processes and credits account

**Tax Benefits:**
- Reduced corporate tax rate for export-oriented industries
- Source tax exemption on export proceeds
- Tax holiday for certain sectors

### 9.4.3 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

Exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact exporter profitability.

#### **Understanding Exchange Rate Risk**

**Scenario:**

An exporter signs a contract to export goods worth USD 100,000 on January 1, when the exchange rate is 1 USD = 110 BDT.

**Expected Realization:** USD 100,000 × 110 = BDT 11,000,000

However, payment is received on April 1, when the exchange rate has changed to 1 USD = 105 BDT.

**Actual Realization:** USD 100,000 × 105 = BDT 10,500,000

**Loss due to exchange rate:** BDT 500,000 (4.5% loss)

**Types of Exchange Rate Exposure:**

**1. Transaction Exposure:**
- Risk between order confirmation and payment receipt
- Most common for exporters
- Can be hedged

**2. Translation Exposure:**
- Accounting impact when consolidating foreign currency assets/liabilities
- Relevant for companies with foreign operations
- Accounting adjustment

**3. Economic Exposure:**
- Long-term competitive impact of exchange rate changes
- Affects pricing strategy
- Strategic consideration

#### **Factors Affecting Exchange Rates**

**Economic Factors:**
- Interest rate differentials
- Inflation rates
- Trade balance
- Economic growth rates
- Government debt levels

**Political Factors:**
- Political stability
- Government policies
- Geopolitical events
- Regulatory changes

**Market Factors:**
- Supply and demand for currency
- Speculation
- Market sentiment
- Global economic conditions

**Bangladesh Context:**
- BDT exchange rate managed by Bangladesh Bank
- Relatively stable with gradual depreciation trend
- Influenced by remittance inflows, trade balance, reserves

#### **Strategies to Manage Exchange Rate Risk**

**Strategy 1: Currency Clauses in Contract**

**Price Adjustment Clause:**
- Contract allows price adjustment based on exchange rate change
- Example: "Price subject to adjustment if exchange rate varies more than 3%"
- Shares risk between buyer and seller

**Currency of Invoice:**
- Invoice in exporter's own currency (BDT) - rare in international trade
- Invoice in third currency (e.g., EUR instead of USD if both prefer)
- Choose stable currency

**Strategy 2: Forward Contract**

**Definition:** Agreement to exchange currencies at predetermined rate on future date

**How It Works:**
1. Exporter signs export contract for USD 100,000, payment in 3 months
2. Current spot rate: 1 USD = 110 BDT
3. Exporter enters forward contract with bank to sell USD 100,000 at 109 BDT (3-month forward rate)
4. After 3 months, regardless of spot rate, exporter receives 109 BDT per USD
5. Exchange rate risk eliminated

**Benefits:**
- Certainty of cash flow
- Protects against adverse movements
- Helps in pricing and budgeting

**Limitations:**
- Cannot benefit if exchange rate moves favorably
- Requires bank relationship and credit limit
- Cost involved (forward margin)

**Availability in Bangladesh:**
- Offered by authorized dealer banks
- For genuine export/import transactions
- Documentation required

**Strategy 3: Money Market Hedge**

**Process:**
1. Borrow in foreign currency
2. Convert to local currency immediately
3. Use export proceeds to repay loan

**Suitable for:**
- Large exporters with banking relationships
- When forward markets are inefficient

**Strategy 4: Leading and Lagging**

**Leading (Advance Payment):**
- Request buyer to pay early if depreciation expected
- Offer discount for early payment

**Lagging (Delayed Payment):**
- Delay realization if appreciation expected
- Within allowed limits (4 months in Bangladesh)

**Legality:**
- Must comply with Bangladesh Bank regulations
- Cannot delay beyond prescribed period

**Strategy 5: Natural Hedging**

**Principle:** Match foreign currency inflows with outflows

**Example:**
- Exporter earning USD also imports raw materials in USD
- USD export proceeds used directly for import payments
- No conversion needed, no exchange rate risk

**Benefits:**
- No cost
- Simplest method
- Suitable for regular exporters and importers

**Implementation:**
- Maintain foreign currency account
- Time imports and exports
- Use ERQ facility

**Strategy 6: Currency Options**

**Definition:** Right (not obligation) to exchange currency at predetermined rate

**Types:**
- **Call Option:** Right to buy foreign currency
- **Put Option:** Right to sell foreign currency

**For Exporters:** Put option (right to sell USD at specified rate)

**Benefits:**
- Protection against adverse movements
- Can benefit from favorable movements (unlike forward)

**Limitations:**
- Premium cost
- Complex product
- Limited availability in Bangladesh

**Strategy 7: Diversification**

**Currency Diversification:**
- Export to multiple countries with different currencies
- Spread risk across currencies

**Market Diversification:**
- Multiple buyers and markets
- Reduces dependence on single currency

**Strategy 8: Pricing Strategy**

**Build in Buffer:**
- Add margin in pricing to absorb exchange rate fluctuations
- Example: Cost + 10% profit + 5% exchange rate buffer

**Regular Price Review:**
- Review and adjust prices periodically
- Renegotiate contracts if major fluctuations

**Strategy 9: Insurance Products**

**Export Credit Insurance:**
- Some policies cover exchange rate fluctuations
- Usually limited coverage
- Check policy terms

#### **Choosing the Right Strategy**

**Considerations:**

| **Factor** | **Consideration** | **Suitable Strategy** |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Transaction Size** | Small value | Natural hedge, price adjustment |
| | Large value | Forward contract, money market hedge |
| **Payment Period** | Short-term (< 3 months) | Leading/lagging, natural hedge |
| | Long-term (> 6 months) | Forward contract, options |
| **Risk Appetite** | Risk-averse | Forward contract (certainty) |
| | Can take some risk | Options (upside potential) |
| **Market Conditions** | Volatile exchange rates | Forward contract, options |
| | Stable exchange rates | Natural hedge, no hedge |
| **Company Profile** | Regular exporter/importer | Natural hedge, FC account |
| | Occasional exporter | Forward contract, price adjustment |

**Best Practice:**
- Assess exposure for each transaction
- Combine multiple strategies
- Monitor exchange rate trends
- Maintain relationship with bank for hedging products

### 9.4.4 Outstanding Export Bills

**Features:**
- Secured by export order/L/C
- Usually 90-180 days tenure
- Can be in BDT or foreign currency
- Interest rate concessional (for export promotion)

**Process:**
1. Exporter submits L/C or firm export order
2. Bank assesses and approves packing credit
3. Loan disbursed to exporter's account
4. Exporter uses for:
   - Purchase of raw materials
   - Processing/manufacturing
   - Packing and labeling
   - Inland transportation
5. Repaid from export proceeds after shipment

**Bangladesh Context:**
- Bangladesh Bank provides refinancing to banks for export credit
- Banks offer competitive rates
- Essential for working capital management

**Benefits:**
- Exporter doesn't need own capital for production
- Enables order fulfillment
- Competitive interest rates

#### **2. Pre-Shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC)**

**Features:**
- Packing credit in foreign currency (usually USD)
- For importers of raw materials who are also exporters
- Hedges exchange rate risk
- Lower interest rate (LIBOR-based)

**Process:**
1. Exporter imports raw materials
2. Bank provides PCFC in USD
3. Exporter uses to pay for imports
4. Repays from export proceeds in USD
5. Natural hedge achieved

**Eligibility:**
- Must have foreign currency earnings
- Valid export order/L/C
- Good track record

#### **3. Back-to-Back L/C**

**Concept:** Opening import L/C backed by export L/C

**Scenario:**
- Exporter receives export L/C
- Needs to import raw materials/inputs
- Bank opens import L/C using export L/C as security

**Process:**
1. Exporter receives master export L/C from foreign buyer
2. Approaches bank to open back-to-back import L/C
3. Bank opens import L/C in favor of supplier
4. Importer (exporter's role) receives goods
5. Processes and exports as per master L/C
6. Export proceeds received
7. Used to settle back-to-back L/C

**Benefits:**
- No need for margin money for import
- Facilitates trade without capital
- Common in merchanting/trading businesses

**Risks for Bank:**
- Both L/Cs must be perfectly matched
- Timing risk (import L/C may mature before export proceeds)

### 9.7.6 Post-Shipment Financing

After goods are shipped but before payment is realized, banks provide various financing options.

#### **1. Document Negotiation**

**Process:**
- Exporter submits documents to bank
- Bank examines documents
- If compliant (or acceptable), bank "negotiates" (purchases) documents
- Provides immediate payment to exporter
- Sends documents to issuing bank for reimbursement

**Negotiation Basis:**

**a) With Recourse:**
- Bank pays exporter but retains right to claim back if issuing bank refuses payment
- Lower charges for exporter
- Exporter bears ultimate risk

**b) Without Recourse:**
- Bank assumes risk of non-payment by issuing bank
- Higher charges for exporter
- Exporter protected (payment guaranteed)

**Charges:**
- Negotiation commission: 0.25% - 0.5%
- SWIFT/courier charges
- Other handling fees

#### **2. Discounting of Export Bills**

**For Usance (Deferred Payment) L/Cs:**

**Scenario:**
- L/C terms: Payment 90 days after shipment
- Exporter needs funds immediately

**Discounting:**
- Bank buys the bill at discount
- Pays exporter present value
- Collects full amount from issuing bank on due date

**Calculation Example:**

Invoice Value: USD 100,000
Payment Terms: 90 days after shipment
Bank's Discount Rate: 8% per annum

Discount Amount = 100,000 × 0.08 × (90/365) = USD 1,973
Amount Paid to Exporter = 100,000 - 1,973 = USD 98,027

**Benefits:**

- Better cash flow
- Can reinvest in business

**Cost:**

- Provides advance to exporter
- Collects from buyer
- Higher risk for bank (no L/C guarantee)
- Higher charges

#### **4. Post-Shipment Credit in Foreign Currency**

**For Usance Export Bills:**
- Loan in foreign currency
- Exporter receives advance
- Repays when export proceeds received

**Benefits:**
- Foreign currency loan at LIBOR rates (lower)
- Hedges currency risk
- Competitive financing cost
