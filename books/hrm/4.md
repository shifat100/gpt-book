## 4.1 Introduction

Recruitment and selection are critical human resource management functions that determine organizational success. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent distinct but interconnected processes:

- **Recruitment** is the process of identifying, attracting, and generating a pool of qualified candidates for organizational vacancies
- **Selection** is the process of choosing the most suitable candidate from the pool of applicants

Together, these processes ensure that organizations acquire the human capital necessary to achieve strategic objectives, maintain competitive advantage, and build sustainable organizational capability.

In today's dynamic business environment, recruitment and selection have evolved from administrative tasks to strategic activities requiring sophisticated approaches, technological tools, and analytical rigor. Organizations that excel at talent acquisition position themselves for long-term success.

## 4.3 Factors Affecting Recruitment

Recruitment effectiveness is influenced by numerous internal and external factors that HR professionals must understand and navigate:

### 4.3.1 Internal Organizational Factors

#### **1. Organizational Size and Growth Stage**

**Impact:**
- Large, established organizations typically have more structured recruitment processes
- Growing companies need aggressive recruitment to support expansion
- Mature organizations focus on replacement and succession
- Start-ups often rely on networks and referrals

**Example:** **Pathao's** rapid expansion from ride-sharing to food delivery and payments required aggressive recruitment across multiple functions, while **Bangladesh Bank** (established institution) focuses on periodic, structured recruitment cycles.

#### **2. Recruitment Policy and Philosophy**

**Key Decisions:**
- Promote-from-within vs. external hiring preference
- Diversity and inclusion commitments
- Geographic recruitment scope (local, national, international)
- Employment types (permanent, contract, temporary)
- Compensation philosophy (market leader, match, lag)

**Example:** **BRAC** has an explicit policy of recruiting from communities where they operate, particularly for field positions, ensuring cultural alignment and local understanding while providing employment opportunities to underserved populations.

#### **3. Organizational Image and Reputation**

**Factors:**
- Employer brand strength
- Industry reputation
- Corporate social responsibility record
- Media coverage and public perception
- Employee reviews (Glassdoor, Indeed, social media)

**Example:** **Unilever Bangladesh** benefits from strong global brand recognition and reputation for management development, making recruitment easier, while lesser-known companies must invest more in employer branding to attract similar talent.

#### **4. Nature of Job and Working Conditions**

**Considerations:**
- Job attractiveness (challenging, routine, dangerous)
- Location and physical environment
- Work schedule and flexibility
- Career development opportunities
- Compensation and benefits package

**Example:** **Chevron Bangladesh** easily attracts petroleum engineers despite offshore work challenges due to prestigious employer brand and excellent compensation, while garment factories in remote locations face recruitment difficulties despite competitive wages.

#### **5. Organizational Culture and Values**

**Impact:**
- Some candidates seek specific cultural environments
- Value alignment affects attraction and retention
- Corporate culture influences referral networks
- Mission-driven organizations attract purpose-oriented candidates

**Example:** **Grameen Bank** attracts candidates passionate about poverty alleviation and social entrepreneurship, while candidates seeking corporate structure and formal hierarchy may find the culture less appealing.

#### **6. Recruitment Budget and Resources**

**Constraints:**
- Available funds for advertising and recruitment activities
- Technology infrastructure (ATS, job portals, recruitment software)
- HR team size and expertise
- Outsourcing options (recruitment agencies, headhunters)

### 4.3.2 External Environmental Factors

#### **1. Labor Market Conditions**

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Tight Labor Market:** High employment, candidate shortage, employer competition
- **Loose Labor Market:** High unemployment, candidate surplus, employer advantage

**Market Segments:**
- Entry-level positions typically have larger candidate pools
- Specialized technical roles face talent shortages
- Geographic variations (Dhaka has deeper talent pool than rural areas)

**Example:** Bangladesh's IT sector experiences **tight labor market** conditions for experienced software developers, data scientists, and cybersecurity specialists, forcing companies like **bKash**, **Pathao**, and **Shohoz** to compete aggressively with higher salaries, flexible work arrangements, and international exposure opportunities.

#### **2. Unemployment Rate and Economic Conditions**

**Relationships:**
- High unemployment → More applicants, easier recruitment
- Economic growth → Talent scarcity, recruitment challenges
- Industry-specific variations (some sectors grow while others contract)

**Example:** During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), hospitality and tourism sectors in Bangladesh faced surplus labor, while e-commerce, logistics, and digital services experienced talent shortages as business demand surged.

#### **3. Labor Laws and Government Regulations**

**Key Regulations:**
- **Bangladesh Labour Act 2006** (amended 2013, 2018)
- Equal employment opportunity requirements
- Minimum wage legislation
- Child labor prohibitions
- Foreign worker restrictions and work permits
- Industry-specific regulations (banking, pharmaceuticals, garments)

**Example:** Commercial banks in Bangladesh must comply with **Bangladesh Bank** directives on minimum qualification requirements, fit-and-proper test criteria for senior positions, and recruitment process documentation for regulatory inspection.

#### **4. Competitor Recruitment Practices**

**Competitive Factors:**
- Salary benchmarks set by competitors
- Innovative recruitment channels used by peers
- Employer branding strategies in the industry
- Talent poaching and counter-offers

**Example:** When **Foodpanda** (now pandaGo) entered Bangladesh, they recruited aggressively from **Pathao** and **Shohoz**, forcing these companies to enhance retention strategies and counter-offer packages while also improving their own recruitment value propositions.

#### **5. Educational and Training Institutions**

**Supply Factors:**
- Quality and quantity of graduates produced
- Curriculum alignment with industry needs
- University reputation and ranking
- Availability of vocational training programs
- Government skill development initiatives

**Example:** **BUET** (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) produces approximately 1,000 engineering graduates annually, creating intense competition among employers like **Grameenphone**, **Robi**, **Walton**, and multinational companies for top performers.

#### **6. Demographic Trends**

**Population Dynamics:**
- Age distribution (Bangladesh has young, growing workforce)
- Gender participation rates
- Urban-rural migration patterns
- Educational attainment levels
- Digital literacy and technology adoption

**Example:** Bangladesh's **demographic dividend**—with approximately 65% of population in working age (15-64 years)—provides large candidate pools, but the challenge lies in matching educational backgrounds with job requirements, particularly for skilled positions.

#### **7. Technology and Digital Transformation**

**Technological Impact:**
- Online job portals and recruitment platforms
- Social media for recruitment marketing
- Mobile-first job search behavior
- AI and automation in candidate screening
- Virtual interviewing capabilities

**Example:** **bdjobs.com**, **BDCareers.com**, and LinkedIn have transformed recruitment in Bangladesh, reducing reliance on newspaper advertisements and enabling faster, more targeted candidate outreach.

#### **8. Socio-Cultural Factors**

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Social attitudes toward work and employment
- Gender norms and workplace participation
- Family influence on career decisions
- Geographic mobility willingness
- Prestige associated with different careers

**Example:** In Bangladesh, engineering and medical professions enjoy high social prestige, making recruitment easier for hospitals and technology companies, while frontline service roles (customer service, sales) face stigma despite competitive compensation, affecting recruitment difficulty.

## 4.4 Sources of Recruitment

Organizations can recruit candidates from various sources, broadly categorized as internal and external. Strategic recruitment involves selecting appropriate source combinations based on organizational needs, position requirements, and resource availability.

### 4.4.1 Internal Sources of Recruitment

**Internal recruitment** involves filling vacancies from within the existing workforce through promotions, transfers, or internal job postings.

#### **Methods of Internal Recruitment:**

**1. Promotions**

**Description:** Moving employees to higher-level positions with increased responsibility, authority, and compensation.

**Process:**
- Identify promotion-eligible employees based on performance and potential
- Announce promotion opportunities through internal channels
- Evaluate candidates using defined criteria
- Make promotion decisions based on merit

**Example:** **HSBC Bangladesh** maintains a structured succession planning process where high-performing Relationship Managers are promoted to Senior Relationship Manager and eventually Assistant Vice President positions based on performance track records and leadership assessments.

**2. Transfers**

**Description:** Moving employees horizontally to different positions at similar organizational levels, departments, or locations.

**Types:**
- **Production Transfer:** Shift from one job to another of similar nature
- **Replacement Transfer:** Filling vacancy created by separation
- **Versatility Transfer:** For employee development and multi-skilling
- **Shift Transfer:** Between different work shifts
- **Remedial Transfer:** To address performance or interpersonal issues

**Example:** **Square Pharmaceuticals** regularly transfers product managers between therapeutic divisions (cardiovascular to respiratory to oncology) to build broad pharmaceutical marketing expertise and prepare them for senior commercial leadership roles.

**3. Internal Job Postings**

**Description:** Advertising vacancies internally through intranets, bulletin boards, newsletters, or internal job portals, allowing employees to apply.

**Process:**
- Post vacancy details (requirements, responsibilities, compensation)
- Provide application deadline and process
- Allow current employees to express interest
- Evaluate internal candidates before external recruitment

**Example:** **Standard Chartered Bangladesh** posts all open positions on their internal career portal, giving existing employees 5-7 days to apply before external recruitment begins, demonstrating commitment to employee development.

**4. Employee Referrals**

**Description:** Current employees recommend qualified candidates from their personal and professional networks.

**Structure:**
- Employees submit referrals through designated process
- Referred candidates receive priority consideration
- Referring employees receive bonuses for successful hires
- Typical referral bonuses: BDT 10,000-50,000 depending on position level

**Example:** **Robi Axiata Limited** runs an active employee referral program offering BDT 25,000 for engineering positions and BDT 15,000 for administrative roles, resulting in approximately 30% of new hires coming through employee referrals.

**5. Former Employees (Boomerang Recruitment)**

**Description:** Re-hiring employees who previously left the organization.

**Rationale:**
- Former employees understand organizational culture
- Reduced onboarding and training time
- Proven performance track record
- Bring external experience and fresh perspectives

**Example:** **Unilever Bangladesh** maintains relationships with alumni through "Unilever Alumni Network," occasionally re-hiring former employees who gained valuable external experience and now return with enhanced capabilities.

**6. Previous Applicants Database**

**Description:** Reviewing applications from qualified candidates who applied for previous positions but weren't selected.

**Advantages:**
- Pre-screened candidate pool
- Reduced recruitment cost and time
- Candidates already familiar with organization

**Example:** **Dutch-Bangla Bank** maintains an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) retaining candidate information for 2 years, searching this database first when similar vacancies arise.

#### **Merits of Internal Recruitment**

| **Advantage** | **Explanation** | **Impact** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cost-Effective** | Lower advertising, screening, and onboarding costs | Reduced recruitment budget requirements |
| **Faster Hiring** | Shorter recruitment cycle; candidates already available | Reduced time-to-fill for critical positions |
| **Known Quantity** | Performance track record and cultural fit already established | Lower hiring risk |
| **Employee Morale** | Career advancement opportunities increase motivation | Higher engagement and retention |
| **Reduced Training** | Familiarity with organizational systems, culture, and processes | Faster productivity achievement |
| **Succession Planning** | Develops internal talent pipeline | Leadership continuity |
| **Retention Tool** | Demonstrates career growth possibilities | Reduces voluntary turnover |
| **Cultural Continuity** | Maintains organizational values and norms | Preserves institutional knowledge |

**Practical Example:**

**BRAC Bank** filled 65% of managerial vacancies through internal promotions, resulting in:
- 40% reduction in recruitment costs compared to external hiring
- Average time-to-productivity of 30 days vs. 90 days for external hires
- Improved employee engagement scores (8.1/10 vs. 7.3/10 previous year)
- Enhanced retention rates (voluntary turnover decreased from 18% to 12%)

#### **Demerits of Internal Recruitment**

| **Disadvantage** | **Explanation** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Limited Talent Pool** | Restricted to current workforce; may lack required skills | Combine with external recruitment for specialized roles |
| **Inbreeding Effect** | Lack of fresh perspectives and innovative thinking | Periodic external hiring at senior levels |
| **Internal Politics** | Favoritism, office politics influence decisions | Transparent selection criteria and process |
| **Cascading Vacancies** | Promotion creates new vacancy requiring backfill | Plan for multiple position fills |
| **Resentment Among Non-Selected** | Unsuccessful internal candidates may become demotivated | Clear communication, feedback, development support |
| **Peter Principle Risk** | Promoting to incompetence level | Rigorous assessment before promotion |
| **Stagnation** | Resistance to change; "we've always done it this way" mentality | Balance internal promotion with external innovation |
| **Skill Gaps** | Current workforce may lack emerging competencies | Invest in training and development |

**Practical Example:**

**Beximco Pharmaceuticals** experienced challenges when promoting high-performing sales representatives to first-line management without adequate leadership training. Many struggled with the transition from individual contributor to people manager, requiring remedial coaching programs and some role reversions.

## 4.7 Introduction to Selection

**Selection** is the process of choosing qualified individuals who have relevant qualifications to fill positions in an organization. While recruitment creates a pool of candidates, selection involves evaluating and choosing the best fit from that pool.

**Key Distinction:**

| **Aspect** | **Recruitment** | **Selection** |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Objective** | Attract candidates | Choose best candidates |
| **Nature** | Positive (encouraging applications) | Negative (eliminating unsuitable applicants) |
| **Process** | Creating applicant pool | Reducing applicant pool |
| **Cost** | Relatively economical | More expensive (assessments, interviews) |
| **Function** | Finding candidates | Evaluating candidates |
| **Outcome** | Large number of applicants | Limited number of offers |

---

## 4.8 The Selection Process

Selection follows a systematic sequence designed to progressively identify the best candidate while efficiently managing time and resources.

### **Typical Selection Process Steps:**

```
Step 1: Preliminary Screening/Reception
           ↓
Step 2: Application Form/Resume Submission
           ↓
Step 3: Employment Tests
           ↓
Step 4: Employment Interview
           ↓
Step 5: Reference and Background Checks
           ↓
Step 6: Medical/Physical Examination

Step 7: Final Selection Decision
           ↓
Step 8: Job Offer
           ↓
Step 9: Employment Contract
```

Let's examine each step in detail:

### **Step 1: Preliminary Screening (Reception/Initial Review)**

**Purpose:**
- Eliminate obviously unqualified candidates early
- Provide information about organization and position
- Create positive first impression
- Save time and resources on detailed evaluation

**Methods:**
- **Walk-in Screening:** Brief interaction with candidates who appear in person
- **Phone Screening:** 10-15 minute conversation covering basics
- **Resume Screening:** Review of submitted applications against minimum criteria

**Screening Criteria:**
- Basic qualifications (education, experience)
- Availability and salary expectations alignment
- Authorization to work
- Geographic flexibility
- Communication skills (phone screening)

**Outcome:**
- Qualified candidates advance
- Unqualified candidates courteously informed
- Typically 50-70% filtered at this stage

**Example:** **BRAC Bank** HR team conducts 15-minute phone screenings for all candidates meeting minimum education/experience criteria, discussing current role, reason for interest, salary expectations, and availability. This reduces 200 applications to 80 candidates invited for written test.

### **Step 2: Application Form/Biodata Submission**

**Purpose:**
- Collect standardized information from all candidates
- Obtain candidate signature (legal documentation)
- Gather data for initial comparison
- Create official record

**Typical Application Form Content:**
- Personal information (name, contact, address)
- Educational background (institutions, degrees, dates, grades)
- Employment history (companies, positions, dates, duties, reasons for leaving)
- Skills and certifications
- References
- Availability and notice period
- Salary expectations
- Declaration and signature

**Design Principles:**
- Request only job-relevant information
- Avoid discriminatory questions (age, marital status, religion unless bona fide occupational qualification)
- Clear, logical organization
- Reasonable length (typically 3-5 pages)
- Legal compliance with employment laws

**Digital vs. Paper:**
- Most organizations now use **online application forms**
- Integrated with Applicant Tracking Systems
- Auto-populates from uploaded resumes
- Easier data analysis and comparison
- Environmentally friendly

**Example:** **Square Pharmaceuticals** online application form includes sections for education, experience, and a specific question: "Describe a situation where you successfully launched a healthcare product in a competitive market," providing early indication of relevant experience and communication skills.

### **Step 3: Employment Tests**

Employment tests are standardized, objective assessments designed to measure specific candidate attributes relevant to job success. This critical step is covered in detail in Section 4.10.

**Common Test Types:**
- Aptitude tests (mental ability, problem-solving)
- Achievement tests (job knowledge, skill proficiency)
- Personality tests (behavioral traits, work style)
- Interest inventories (career preferences, motivation)
- Situational judgment tests (decision-making scenarios)

### **Step 4: Employment Interview**

The interview is typically the most influential selection tool, involving face-to-face conversation to assess candidate suitability. This is covered extensively in Section C: Interviewing.

**Interview Types:**
- Screening interviews (brief, preliminary)
- Technical interviews (job-specific competency)
- Behavioral interviews (past behavior examples)
- Panel interviews (multiple interviewers)
- Final interviews (senior management)

### **Step 5: Reference and Background Checks**

**Purpose:**

**Legal Considerations:**
- Medical examination **after** conditional offer (not before)
- Job-relatedness of all medical requirements
- Reasonable accommodation for disabilities
- Confidentiality of medical information
- Compliance with Bangladesh Labour Act and disability rights

**Medical Fitness Standards:**

- Respiratory function tests
- Vision and color blindness testing (safety critical)
- Psychological fitness evaluation
- Annual re-certification for continued employment

**Occupational Health Focus:**
Examinations also serve preventive health purpose, identifying conditions early and promoting employee wellness.

### **Step 7: Final Selection Decision**

**Process:**
- Hiring team reviews all assessment data
- Compare candidates against selection criteria
- Discuss strengths, concerns, and fit
- Reach consensus or hierarchical decision
- Final approval from appropriate authority
- Document selection rationale

**Decision-Making Approaches:**

**A. Compensatory Model**
- High scores in some areas offset lower scores in others
- Total score across all criteria determines selection
- Allows for well-rounded candidates with varied strengths

**B. Multiple Hurdle Model**
- Candidates must meet minimum threshold on each criterion
- Failure on any criterion results in elimination
- Ensures baseline competence across all requirements

**C. Clinical Approach**
- Decision-makers use judgment to interpret data
- Holistic evaluation considering context and intangibles
- Subjective but experienced-based

**D. Statistical/Actuarial Approach**

Most organizations use **combination approach**: statistical methods narrow field, clinical judgment makes final choice.

**Documentation:**
- Record rationale for selection decision
- Note key strengths of selected candidate
- Document concerns about rejected finalists
- Maintain for legal defensibility and organizational learning

**Example:** **Standard Chartered Bangladesh** Relationship Manager selection involves:
- Weighted scoring across assessments (test: 20%, technical interview: 30%, behavioral interview: 30%, references: 10%, overall fit: 10%)
- Candidates must meet minimum threshold (70%) on each component
- Final decision made by Branch Manager, HR Business Partner, and Regional Head jointly
- Decision rationale documented in selection summary form

### **Step 8: Job Offer**

Covered in detail in Section A (Recruitment Process, Step 7).

- Limited breaks and restroom scheduling

This honesty results in 15% of candidates withdrawing, but those who join have 30% higher retention rates.

### 4.9.7 Privacy and Confidentiality

**Principle:** Protect candidate personal information and selection data.

**Practices:**
- Secure storage of application materials
- Limited access to candidate information
- Confidential reference check discussions
- Discreet background investigation
- Non-disclosure of selection decisions to unauthorized parties

**Legal Compliance:**
- Data protection regulations
- Candidate consent for information use
- Right to access own information
- Information retention policies

### 4.9.8 Continuous Improvement

**Principle:** Regularly evaluate and enhance selection effectiveness.

**Activities:**
- Track selection process metrics
- Validate selection methods against performance
- Gather feedback from candidates and hiring managers
- Update methods based on evidence

- Predicts performance and cultural fit
- Can assess judgment, ethics, interpersonal skills

**Example SJT Item:**

```
**SITUATION:**
You are a customer service representative. A client calls extremely angry because they were charged twice for the same transaction. You check the system and confirm the double charge. However, refunds require manager approval, and your manager is in an important meeting for the next hour.

**What would you MOST LIKELY do?**
A) Apologize sincerely, explain the verification process, and promise to personally follow up with manager and call customer back within 2 hours with resolution
B) Tell customer you've confirmed the error and they should call back in 2 hours when your manager is available
C) Interrupt your manager's meeting to get immediate approval since the customer is very upset
D) Process the refund immediately yourself even though it requires manager approval, to satisfy the angry customer

**What would you LEAST LIKELY do?**
[Same options]

**Scoring:**
Most Likely: A=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point, B=0 points
Least Likely: B=3 points, D=2 points, C=1 point, A=0 points
```

**bKash** uses situational judgment tests for customer service and fraud prevention roles, presenting scenarios involving:

**Example:** **Dutch-Bangla Bank** administers integrity assessment for teller positions, including questions about:
- Attitudes toward taking office supplies home
- Responses to witnessing colleague misconduct
- Hypothetical scenarios involving cash discrepancies
- Past experiences with ethical dilemmas

### 4.10.3 Guidelines to Set Up a Test Program

Establishing an effective employment testing program requires careful planning and execution:

#### **Step 1: Conduct Job Analysis**

**Activities:**
- Identify critical knowledge, skills, abilities for job success
- Determine which attributes can be effectively tested
- Distinguish between can-learn and must-have competencies
- Prioritize characteristics for assessment

**Example:** For "Software Developer" position:
- **Must Test:** Programming language proficiency, problem-solving, logical thinking
- **Can Assess Otherwise:** Teamwork (interview), communication (interview)
- **Less Critical:** Personality traits

#### **Step 2: Define Testing Objectives**

**Key Questions:**
- What specific attributes will tests measure?
- How will test results be used (screening, ranking, final decision)?
- What level of proficiency is required?
- How will tests integrate with other selection methods?

**Example:** **Grameenphone** Network Engineer testing objectives:
- **Primary:** Assess telecommunications technical knowledge
- **Secondary:** Evaluate problem-solving under pressure
- **Usage:** Minimum threshold (70%) for interview invitation; score weighted 30% in final decision

#### **Step 3: Select or Develop Appropriate Tests**

**Options:**

**A. Purchase Standardized Tests**
- **Advantages:** Professionally developed, validated, normed, immediate availability
- **Disadvantages:** Generic (not job-specific), ongoing licensing costs, less customization
- **Examples:** Wonderlic Personnel Test, Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking, SHL assessments

**B. Develop Custom Tests**
- **Advantages:** Job-specific content, organizational alignment, proprietary
- **Disadvantages:** Development cost/time, validation required, expertise needed
- **Process:** SME input, item writing, pilot testing, refinement

**C. Hybrid Approach**
- Standardized general ability tests + custom job knowledge/work sample tests
- Balance efficiency and specificity

**Decision Factors:**
- Position criticality and volume
- Available budget and resources
- Internal testing expertise
- Timeline constraints
- Legal defensibility requirements

**Example:** **BRAC Bank** uses:
- **Standardized:** SHL Numerical and Verbal Reasoning Tests (cognitive ability)
- **Custom:** Banking knowledge test and customer service case study (job-specific)
- This combination provides comprehensive, cost-effective assessment

#### **Step 4: Establish Test Administration Procedures**

**Standardization Requirements:**
- Identical instructions for all candidates
- Same time limits and conditions
- Controlled testing environment (quiet, well-lit, distraction-free)
- Consistent materials and equipment
- Trained test administrators
- Security protocols (prevent cheating, test compromise)

**Logistics:**
- Testing location and facilities
- Scheduling system
- Candidate communication (what to bring, how to prepare)
- Accommodation for disabilities
- Technology requirements (computers, internet, software)

**Example:** **Bangladesh Bank** Officer examination administration:
- Simultaneous testing at 8 centers across Bangladesh
- Standardized question booklets sealed until test time
- Identical 2-hour time limit nationwide
- Photo ID verification required
- Mobile phones prohibited
- Invigilators trained in standardized procedures
- OMR answer sheet technology for objective scoring

#### **Step 5: Develop Scoring System and Cut-off Scores**

**Scoring Methods:**

**A. Objective Scoring**
- Multiple choice, true/false, matching
- Computer-scored for consistency
- Immediate results

**B. Subjective Scoring**
- Essay questions, work samples, simulations
- Requires trained evaluators
- Scoring rubrics for consistency
- Inter-rater reliability checks

**Cut-off Score Determination:**

**Methods:**
1. **Statistical Analysis:** Analyze score distribution, set at appropriate percentile
2. **Expert Judgment:** Subject matter experts determine minimum competency level
3. **Predictive Validation:** Correlate test scores with performance, identify optimal threshold
4. **Normative:** Based on comparison to relevant population

**Considerations:**
- Balance selectivity vs. filling positions
- Adverse impact monitoring (ensure fairness across groups)
- Business necessity justification

**Example:** **Square Pharmaceuticals** Product Manager test scoring:
- **Pharmaceutical Knowledge:** 100 points (objective scoring)
- **Case Analysis:** 100 points (rubric-scored by two evaluators, averaged)
- **Total:** 200 points
- **Cut-off:** 140 points (70%) for interview invitation
- **Final Decision:** Test score weighted 40% combined with interview (40%) and references (20%)

#### **Step 6: Validate the Testing Program**

**Validation** demonstrates that test scores relate to job performance, ensuring tests measure what they claim and predict success.

**Validation Types:**

**A. Content Validity**
- Test content represents actual job content
- Subject matter experts confirm job-relatedness
- Most practical for small organizations

**B. Criterion-Related Validity**
- Test scores correlate with performance measures
- **Predictive:** Test candidates, hire, later compare scores to performance
- **Concurrent:** Test current employees, correlate scores with performance

**C. Construct Validity**
- Test measures theoretical construct (e.g., "analytical thinking")
- Construct relates to job performance
- More academic, less practical for most organizations

**Validation Process Example:**

**Robi Axiata** validated customer service representative test:
1. Administered test to 200 current high-performing CSRs
2. Correlated test scores with performance metrics (customer satisfaction, handling time, quality scores)
3. Found correlation of r=0.68 (strong positive relationship)
4. Established cut-off score of 75th percentile
5. Monitored new hires: those scoring above cut-off showed 25% higher performance ratings after 6 months

#### **Step 7: Monitor for Adverse Impact**

**Adverse Impact:** When selection procedure disproportionately excludes protected groups.

**Four-Fifths Rule:**
- Selection rate for protected group should be at least 80% of highest group
- Example: If 60% of male candidates pass test, at least 48% (60% × 0.80) of female candidates should pass

**Monitoring Process:**
- Track pass rates by demographic groups
- Calculate selection ratios
- Investigate significant disparities
- Modify tests if unwarranted adverse impact

**Corrective Actions if Adverse Impact Found:**
- Review test content for bias
- Develop alternative selection methods
- Adjust cut-off scores if justified
- Seek alternative predictors

#### **Step 8: Implement Security and Confidentiality Measures**

**Test Security:**
- Secure storage of test materials
- Limited access to authorized personnel
- Prevent test compromise (candidates sharing content)
- Rotate test forms if possible
- Non-disclosure agreements for candidates

**Result Confidentiality:**
- Access limited to need-to-know
- Secure data storage (electronic and physical)
- Compliance with privacy regulations
- Candidate access to own results

#### **Step 9: Provide Test Feedback and Communication**

**Candidate Communication:**
- Explanation of test purpose and process
- Results notification timeline
- Opportunity to discuss results (optional)
- Retest policies (if applicable)
- Appeals process for concerns

**Example:** **Standard Chartered Bank** provides test-takers:
- Pre-test: Email explaining test types, duration, scoring, how results will be used
- Post-test: Results notification within 5 days
- Successful candidates: Advance to interview
- Unsuccessful candidates: Encouragement to reapply after 6 months with additional skill development

#### **Step 10: Continuous Evaluation and Improvement**

**Ongoing Activities:**
- Regular validation studies
- Candidate feedback collection
- Test effectiveness analysis (correlation with performance)
- Updates based on job changes
- Benchmarking against best practices
- Technology upgrades

**Example:** **Banglalink** annually reviews testing program:
- Validation study every 2 years
- Quarterly analysis of pass rates and hiring outcomes
- Candidate satisfaction surveys
- Test content updated for technology changes
- Transition from paper to online testing based on evaluation

## 4.11 Reliability and Validity in Selection Testing

Understanding reliability and validity is crucial for developing and implementing effective selection tools.

### 4.11.1 Reliability

**Definition:** **Reliability** is the consistency and stability of measurement. A reliable test produces similar results when administered multiple times under similar conditions.

**Key Question:** Does the test consistently measure what it's intended to measure?

**Types of Reliability:**

#### **1. Test-Retest Reliability**

**Description:** Consistency of test scores when same test is administered to same individuals at different times.

**Method:**
- Administer test to group
- Wait appropriate time period (2-4 weeks)
- Re-administer same test to same group
- Calculate correlation between scores

**Interpretation:**
- High correlation (r > 0.80) indicates good reliability
- Low correlation suggests measurement inconsistency

**Limitations:**
- Memory effects (candidates remember questions)
- Learning between tests
- Not practical for most employment testing

**Example:** Personality test administered to group in January and again in March yields correlation of r=0.85, indicating stable, reliable measurement of personality traits.

#### **2. Parallel Forms Reliability (Equivalent Forms)**

**Description:** Consistency between two different versions of the same test measuring the same construct.

**Method:**
- Develop two equivalent test forms
- Administer both forms to same group (counterbalanced order)
- Calculate correlation between scores

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates memory effects
- Useful when candidates may retake tests
- Provides test security

**Example:** **Bangladesh Bank** develops Form A and Form B of Officer examination with equivalent difficulty and content coverage, allowing different forms for retakes without memory advantage.

#### **3. Internal Consistency Reliability**

**Description:** Consistency among items within a single test administration.

**Methods:**

**A. Split-Half Reliability**
- Divide test into two halves (odd/even items, first half/second half)
- Score each half separately
- Calculate correlation between halves
- Apply Spearman-Brown formula to estimate full test reliability

**B. Cronbach's Alpha**
- Statistical measure of internal consistency
- Ranges from 0 to 1.0
- Alpha > 0.70 generally considered acceptable
- Alpha > 0.80 indicates good reliability
- Alpha > 0.90 indicates excellent reliability

**Example:** Aptitude test with 50 items has Cronbach's Alpha of 0.87, indicating high internal consistency—items consistently measure same construct.

#### **4. Inter-Rater Reliability**

**Description:** Consistency of ratings/scores between different evaluators/raters.

**Application:**
- Subjectively scored tests (essays, work samples)
- Interview ratings
- Performance evaluations
- Assessment center exercises

**Method:**
- Multiple raters independently score same performance
- Calculate agreement percentage or correlation between raters
- Cohen's Kappa or Intra-class Correlation (ICC) statistics

**Target:** Inter-rater reliability > 0.80 desirable

**Example:** **Grameenphone** has two HR professionals independently score each Management Trainee case study presentation. If inter-rater reliability is r=0.75, scores are averaged. If r<0.70, third rater brought in to resolve discrepancy.

**Improving Inter-Rater Reliability:**
- Clear, detailed scoring rubrics
- Rater training and calibration
- Defined rating scale anchors
- Regular rater meetings to discuss standards

---

### 4.11.2 Validity

**Definition:** **Validity** is the extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure and predicts what it's intended to predict.

**Key Question:** Does the test actually measure job-relevant attributes and predict job performance?

**Relationship Between Reliability and Validity:**
- Reliability is **necessary but not sufficient** for validity
- A test can be reliable (consistent) but not valid (not measuring right thing)
- A test cannot be valid if it's not reliable
- Analogy: A broken clock showing wrong time consistently is reliable but not valid

**Types of Validity:**

#### **1. Content Validity**

**Definition:** Extent to which test content represents the job content domain.

**Key Question:** Does the test include a representative sample of knowledge/skills required on the job?

**Establishment Method:**
- Conduct thorough job analysis
- Identify critical knowledge, skills, tasks
- Develop test items covering these areas
- Subject matter experts review and confirm job-relatedness

**Advantages:**
- Most practical and feasible for most organizations
- No statistical analysis required
- Logical, face-valid approach

**Limitations:**
- Subjective expert judgment
- Doesn't empirically demonstrate performance prediction
- Requires comprehensive job analysis

**Example:** **Square Pharmaceuticals** pharmaceutical knowledge test for Product Managers includes questions on:
- Cardiovascular disease states and treatments (20% of test)
- Pharmaceutical marketing regulations (15%)
- Market research methodologies (15%)
- Brand management principles (20%)
- Competitive analysis techniques (15%)
- Budget management (15%)

Content domain matches job analysis showing these topics comprise Product Manager role. Three senior Brand Managers reviewed test confirming content validity.

#### **2. Criterion-Related Validity**

**Definition:** Extent to which test scores correlate with actual job performance measures (criteria).

**Key Question:** Do higher test scores predict better job performance?

**Types:**

**A. Predictive Validity**

**Process:**
1. Administer test to all job applicants
2. Hire individuals without considering test scores
3. After suitable time period (6-12 months), measure job performance
4. Correlate test scores with performance ratings
5. High correlation indicates predictive validity

**Advantages:**
- Most rigorous validity evidence
- Directly demonstrates performance prediction

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming (requires waiting for performance data)
- Requires large sample size
- Must hire poor test performers (ethical concerns)

**Example Study:**

**Robi Axiata** validated customer service test:
- 200 candidates took test (scores not used in hiring decisions initially)
- All 200 hired and trained
- After 6 months, collected performance data:
  - Customer satisfaction scores
  - Average handling time
  - Quality assurance ratings
  - Attendance records
- Calculated correlation: r=0.65 between test scores and composite performance
- **Conclusion:** Test has good predictive validity; implemented as selection tool

**B. Concurrent Validity**

**Process:**
1. Administer test to current employees
2. Collect current performance ratings
3. Correlate test scores with performance ratings
4. High correlation indicates validity

**Advantages:**
- Faster than predictive validity
- No need to wait for performance data
- Doesn't require hiring poor performers

**Disadvantages:**
- Current employees may differ from applicants
- Range restriction (poor performers already terminated)
- Current employees may lack motivation on test

**Example:**

**BRAC Bank** validated Relationship Manager assessment:
- Administered test to 150 current RMs
- Collected performance ratings and sales data
- Correlation: r=0.58 between test and performance
- **Conclusion:** Moderate validity demonstrated; test implemented with ongoing monitoring

**Validity Coefficient Interpretation:**

| **Correlation (r)** | **Interpretation** | **Practical Significance** |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 0.00 - 0.10 | Negligible | Test has no predictive value |
| 0.11 - 0.30 | Weak | Limited practical utility |
| 0.31 - 0.50 | Moderate | Useful for selection decisions |
| 0.51 - 0.70 | Strong | Very good predictor |
| 0.71 - 1.00 | Very Strong | Excellent predictor |

**Note:** In employment context, validities of 0.30-0.50 are common and practically significant given complexity of predicting human performance.

#### **3. Construct Validity**

**Definition:** Extent to which test measures the theoretical construct (abstract characteristic) it purports to measure.

**Key Question:** Does the test actually measure "analytical thinking," "customer service orientation," or whatever construct it claims?

**Establishment Methods:**
- Convergent validity: Test correlates with other measures of same construct
- Discriminant validity: Test does not correlate with measures of different constructs
- Factor analysis: Statistical technique identifying underlying constructs

**Example:**

"Analytical Thinking" test should:
- **Correlate positively** with other analytical measures (math tests, logic puzzles)
- **Not correlate** with unrelated traits (extraversion, physical strength)

**Application:**
More relevant for academic research than practical employment testing, but important for understanding what tests measure.

---

### 4.11.3 Sources of Unreliability in Testing

Several factors can introduce error and reduce test reliability:

#### **1. Test Length**

**Issue:** Shorter tests are less reliable than longer tests (fewer items = more random error).

**Solution:**
- Include sufficient items (typically 20+ for reliable measurement)
- Balance thoroughness with candidate fatigue
- Use Spearman-Brown formula to estimate reliability based on length

**Example:** 10-item test has reliability of 0.60; increasing to 20 items raises reliability to approximately 0.75.

#### **2. Item Ambiguity and Poor Clarity**

**Issue:** Confusing, unclear, or poorly worded test items introduce measurement error.

**Causes:**
- Double-barreled questions (asking two things simultaneously)
- Unclear instructions
- Ambiguous response options
- Complex, jargon-filled language

**Solution:**
- Clear, concise item writing
- Pilot test with sample candidates
- Subject matter expert review
- Professional editing

**Example of Poor Item:**
"Do you enjoy working with people and prefer individual work?" (Double-barreled, confusing)

**Improved:**
"I enjoy working collaboratively with team members." (Clear, single concept)

#### **3. Environmental Factors**

**Issue:** Testing conditions affect performance and introduce error.

**Factors:**
- Noise and distractions
- Poor lighting or uncomfortable temperature
- Inadequate workspace
- Time pressure or interruptions
- Technical problems (computer issues, slow internet)

**Solution:**
- Standardized, controlled testing environment
- Quiet, comfortable, well-lit rooms
- Functional equipment checked before testing
- Consistent conditions for all candidates

**Example:** Candidate taking online test at home with children interrupting performs worse than actual ability, introducing measurement error.

#### **4. Candidate Factors**

**Issue:** Temporary personal conditions affect test performance.

**Factors:**
- Physical illness or fatigue
- Anxiety and test-taking stress
- Lack of sleep or hunger
- Emotional distress
- Substance use (medication, alcohol)

**Mitigation:**
- Flexible rescheduling for illness
- Clear communication reducing anxiety
- Reasonable break allowances
- Test environment designed for comfort

**Example:** Highly qualified candidate has severe migraine during test, scores poorly, is incorrectly screened out.

#### **5. Scoring Errors**

**Issue:** Inconsistent or incorrect scoring introduces error.

**Causes:**
- Subjective scoring without clear rubrics
- Rater bias and inconsistency
- Computational errors
- Data entry mistakes

**Solution:**
- Objective scoring where possible (multiple choice, computer-scored)
- Detailed scoring rubrics for subjective items
- Multiple raters with inter-rater reliability checks
- Double-checking and verification procedures

**Example:** Two interviewers rate same candidate—one gives 7/10, other gives 4/10 due to different interpretation of rating scale, indicating scoring unreliability.

#### **6. Guessing**

**Issue:** Random guessing on multiple-choice items introduces error, particularly when candidates have no knowledge.

**Mitigation:**
- Penalties for wrong answers (correction for guessing formula)
- Adequate time to reduce random guessing from time pressure
- Sufficient item difficulty to differentiate knowledge levels
- Include "I don't know" option

**Example:** Candidate randomly guesses on 20 of 50 items, statistically getting 5 correct by chance, inflating score and reducing reliability.

#### **7. Lack of Standardization**

**Issue:** Varying administration procedures across candidates introduces error.

**Variations:**
- Different time limits
- Different instructions or clarifications
- Different testing materials
- Different environmental conditions

**Solution:**
- Strict standardization protocols
- Trained test administrators
- Identical procedures for all candidates
- Quality control monitoring

**Example:** One candidate receives extra 10 minutes while another strictly timed at 60 minutes—introduces unfairness and measurement error.

#### **8. Range Restriction**

**Issue:** When test-takers represent limited ability range, reliability estimates are artificially lowered.

**Example:**
- Administering test only to university graduates restricts range (all relatively high ability)
- True reliability higher in unrestricted population

**Statistical Consideration:**
- Recognize when samples are range-restricted
- Apply statistical corrections if conducting validation studies

#### **9. Test-Taking Skills and Familiarity**

**Issue:** Some candidates better at taking tests regardless of actual knowledge/ability.

**Factors:**
- Prior test-taking experience
- Test-wiseness strategies
- Familiarity with format
- Coaching and preparation

**Mitigation:**
- Provide sample questions and practice tests
- Clear instructions and format explanation
- Balance test-wiseness advantage through multiple assessment methods

**Example:** Candidate A has extensive standardized test experience and knows strategies (eliminate obviously wrong answers, manage time), outperforming equally knowledgeable Candidate B who lacks test-taking skills.

---

**Reliability and Validity Summary:**

**Key Principles:**
1. Both reliability and validity are essential for effective selection tests
2. Reliability is necessary foundation—unreliable tests cannot be valid
3. Validity demonstrates test measures what matters for job success
4. Multiple sources of error threaten reliability—minimize through careful test design and administration
5. Validation is ongoing process, not one-time event
6. Legal defensibility requires job-related, valid selection procedures

## 4.15 Common Interviewing Techniques

### 4.15.1 Behavioral Interview Technique

**Premise:** Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.

**Approach:** Ask candidates to describe specific past situations demonstrating relevant competencies.

**STAR Method Framework:**

- **S**ituation: Context and background
- **T**ask: Specific responsibility or challenge
- **A**ction: What candidate specifically did
- **R**esult: Outcome and lessons learned

**Sample Behavioral Questions:**

1. **Leadership:**
*"Describe a situation where you had to lead a team through a significant change. What was your approach, and what was the outcome?"*

2. **Problem-Solving:**
*"Tell me about the most complex problem you've solved at work. Walk me through your thought process and solution."*

3. **Conflict Resolution:**
*"Give me an example of a time you had a significant disagreement with a colleague. How did you handle it?"*

4. **Initiative:**
*"Describe a time when you identified an opportunity for improvement that others had missed. What did you do about it?"*

5. **Adaptability:**
*"Tell me about a time when you had to quickly adapt to a major change at work. How did you manage?"*

**Interviewer Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What specifically did YOU do?" (vs. "we")
- "Why did you choose that approach?"
- "What was challenging about this situation?"
- "What would you do differently knowing what you know now?"
- "What did you learn from this experience?"

**Red Flags:**
- Vague, general answers lacking specifics
- "We" language without clarifying personal contribution
- Theoretical responses instead of actual examples
- Inability to recall specific situations
- Blame-oriented responses

**Example Evaluation:**

**POOR RESPONSE:**
"I'm great at handling difficult customers. I always stay calm and professional. Customers appreciate good service, so I make sure to provide that."
*(Vague, no specific example, no STAR structure)*

**STRONG RESPONSE:**
"At my previous position with Banglalink, I received a call from a corporate client whose entire office had lost mobile service during a critical business deal. *[Situation]* My task was to restore service quickly and maintain the relationship. *[Task]* I immediately escalated to our network team while staying on the line with the client, providing updates every 5 minutes. I arranged temporary mobile hotspot devices to be delivered within the hour. Once service was restored, I followed up with a personal apology letter and one month's service credit. *[Action]* The client not only continued their contract but expanded to 50 additional lines and referred two other corporate clients. *[Result]* This experience taught me the importance of proactive communication during crises."
*(Specific, detailed, follows STAR, demonstrates competencies)*

### 4.15.2 Situational Interview Technique

**Premise:** Assess how candidates would handle hypothetical future scenarios.

**Approach:** Present job-related scenarios and ask how they would respond.

**Sample Situational Questions:**

1. **Decision-Making:**
*"Imagine you discover your team member has been falsifying sales reports. What would you do?"*

2. **Time Management:**
*"You have three urgent projects due tomorrow, but you can realistically complete only two. How would you decide which to prioritize?"*

3. **Customer Service:**
*"A customer insists on speaking with your manager about a policy you cannot change. Your manager is unavailable. How would you handle this?"*

4. **Ethical Dilemma:**
*"Your supervisor asks you to slightly modify data in a report to make results look better. What would you do?"*

5. **Team Conflict:**
*"Two of your team members are constantly arguing, affecting team morale and productivity. How would you address this?"*

**Evaluation Approach:**
- Compare candidate's proposed approach to ideal response
- Assess reasoning and judgment
- Evaluate alignment with organizational values
- Consider practicality and feasibility

**Advantages:**
- All candidates face same scenarios
- Assesses judgment and decision-making
- Evaluates cultural and ethical alignment

**Limitations:**
- Candidates may provide socially desirable answers
- Actual behavior may differ from stated intentions
- Less predictive than behavioral interviews

**Best Practice:** **Combine situational with behavioral questions** for comprehensive assessment.

### 4.15.3 Competency-Based Interview Technique

**Approach:** Structure interview around specific competencies required for job success.

**Process:**
1. Identify critical competencies from job analysis
2. Define behavioral indicators for each competency

**Example Competency Framework:**

**Competency: Customer Focus**

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Seeks to understand customer needs deeply
- Goes beyond minimum requirements to satisfy customers
- Follows up to ensure customer satisfaction
- Recovers effectively from service failures

**Interview Questions:**
1. "Describe a time when you went above and beyond standard service to help a customer."
2. "Tell me about a situation where you had to balance customer demands with company policies."
3. "Give an example of how you've used customer feedback to improve your service."

**Rating:** Each competency rated on 1-5 scale based on response quality

**Advantages:**
- Direct linkage to job requirements
- Comprehensive assessment across all critical areas
- Structured evaluation framework
- Supports development planning for hires

**Example:** **BRAC Bank** Relationship Manager interviews assess five competencies:
1. Customer Relationship Management
2. Financial Analysis
3. Sales Orientation
4. Integrity and Ethics
5. Collaboration

Each competency has 2-3 targeted questions; candidate must demonstrate competency through specific examples.

### 4.15.4 Case Interview Technique

**Approach:** Present business problem requiring analysis and recommendation.

**Common in:** Consulting, strategy, analytical roles

**Types:**
- **Market Sizing:** "How many cars are sold in Dhaka annually?"
- **Business Problem:** "Our client's profits have declined 20% in two years. What could be causing this, and what would you recommend?"
- **Brain Teaser:** "Why are manhole covers round?"

**Assessment Focus:**
- Analytical thinking
- Problem-solving approach
- Communication of complex ideas
- Business acumen
- Comfort with ambiguity

**Example:**

*"Square Pharmaceuticals is considering launching a new cardiovascular drug in Bangladesh. The drug has been successful in India but faces competition from established generics. How would you assess this opportunity and what factors would influence your go/no-go recommendation?"*

**Expected Approach:**
- Clarifying questions about drug, market, competition
- Structured framework (market size, competition, pricing, regulations, capabilities)
- Quantitative analysis where possible
- Balanced recommendation considering risks and opportunities

**Evaluation:** Process and thinking quality matter more than "right answer"

### 4.15.5 Technical Interview Technique

**Approach:** Assess job-specific technical knowledge and skills.

**Methods:**
- Direct technical questioning

## 4.16 Problems and Issues in Interviewing

Despite being the most widely used selection method, interviews are susceptible to numerous errors and biases that reduce effectiveness:

### 4.16.1 Common Interviewer Biases

**1. First Impression Bias (Primacy Effect)**

**Description:** Interviewer forms judgment within first 3-5 minutes, then seeks confirming evidence.

**Impact:** Subsequent information filtered through initial impression; strong opening overcomes later weaknesses.

**Example:** Candidate arrives professionally dressed, offers firm handshake, makes strong eye contact. Interviewer unconsciously rates candidate positively despite mediocre answers later.

**Mitigation:**
- Structured interviews reduce early judgment
- Evaluate entire interview, not just opening
- Awareness of bias tendency
- Take detailed notes for objective review

**2. Halo Effect**

**Description:** One positive trait influences overall evaluation; candidate rated highly across all dimensions based on single strength.

**Example:** Candidate graduated from prestigious university (BUET). Interviewer assumes candidate must also be hardworking, intelligent, and capable, rating all competencies highly without adequate evidence.

**Opposite: Horns Effect:** Single negative trait creates overall negative evaluation.

**Mitigation:**
- Evaluate each competency independently
- Seek specific evidence for each dimension
- Use structured rating scales
- Multiple interviewers provide checks

**3. Similarity Bias (Like Me Bias)**

**Description:** Interviewer favors candidates who share similar backgrounds, interests, or characteristics.

**Example:** Interviewer and candidate both attended same university, support same cricket team, grew up in same neighborhood. Interviewer feels personal connection and rates candidate more favorably.

**Impact:** Reduces diversity; perpetuates homogeneous workforce; may overlook better-qualified dissimilar candidates.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on job-relevant criteria
- Diverse interview panels
- Structured questions and evaluation
- Awareness training

**4. Contrast Effect**

**Description:** Candidate evaluated relative to previous candidates rather than absolute standards.

**Example:** After interviewing three weak candidates, average candidate appears excellent by comparison and is rated higher than deserved.

**Conversely:** Strong candidate following excellent candidates appears weaker.

**Mitigation:**
- Evaluate each candidate against job requirements, not others
- Avoid back-to-back comparison discussions
- Use absolute rating standards
- Review all candidates before final decisions

**5. Stereotyping and Prejudice**

**Description:** Generalizations about groups (gender, age, ethnicity, appearance) influence individual assessment.

**Examples:**
- "Older workers resist technology"
- "Women are less committed due to family responsibilities"
- "Young people lack work ethic"
- "Candidates from X region are Y"

**Impact:** Illegal discrimination; loss of qualified talent; legal liability.

**Mitigation:**
- Diversity and unconscious bias training
- Structured, job-focused interviews
- Multiple interviewers
- Legal compliance monitoring
- Zero tolerance for discriminatory practices

**6. Recency Effect**

**Description:** Information presented last is weighted more heavily than earlier information.

**Example:** Candidate stumbles early but finishes strong with impressive closing statement. Interviewer focuses on strong finish, discounting earlier weaknesses.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive note-taking throughout interview
- Structured evaluation considering entire interview
- Review notes before rating

**7. Confirmation Bias**

**Description:** Interviewer seeks information confirming pre-existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.

**Example:** Resume suggests candidate is detail-oriented. Interviewer asks questions expecting to confirm this, overlooking examples of careless errors.

**Mitigation:**
- Ask balanced questions exploring strengths AND weaknesses
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Devil's advocate approach in panel discussions

**8. Personal Liking Bias**

**Description:** Interviewer's personal feelings toward candidate influence professional evaluation.

**Example:** Interviewer finds candidate charming, humorous, and likable. Positive feelings translate to inflated competency ratings.

**Impact:** Confuses interpersonal attraction with job qualifications.

**Mitigation:**
- Separate "Would I enjoy working with this person?" from "Can this person do the job?"
- Focus on evidence of competencies
- Multiple interviewers provide objectivity

### 4.16.2 Structural Interview Problems

**1. Lack of Standardization**

**Problem:** Different questions asked of different candidates; inconsistent evaluation criteria.

**Impact:** Unfair comparison; reduced validity; legal vulnerability.

**Solution:** Structured interview guides; consistent questions and rating scales.

**2. Poor Question Quality**

**Problem:** Vague, leading, or non-job-related questions.

**Examples of Poor Questions:**
- "Tell me about yourself" (Too broad, unfocused)
- "You seem like a hard worker, aren't you?" (Leading)
- "What's your greatest weakness?" (Cliché, uninformative)
- "Are you married?" (Illegal, discriminatory)

**Solution:** Job-related behavioral and situational questions; interviewer training.

**3. Inadequate Preparation**

**Problem:** Interviewer hasn't reviewed materials or prepared questions.

**Impact:** Unprofessional impression; poor candidate experience; ineffective assessment.

**Solution:** Mandatory preparation time; interview guides; accountability.

**4. Interruptions and Distractions**

**Problem:** Phone calls, emails, people entering room during interview.

**Impact:** Breaks rapport; signals disrespect; incomplete assessment.

**Solution:** Dedicated, private interview space; hold calls; block calendar.

### 4.16.3 Candidate Deception and Dishonesty

**Types of Dishonesty:**

**1. Resume Falsification**
- Education credentials (degree, institution, graduation date)
- Employment dates and titles
- Salary and compensation claims
- Accomplishments and achievements

**2. Interview Deception**
- Exaggerated responsibilities and achievements
- Taking credit for team accomplishments
- Fabricated examples in behavioral questions
- Concealing negative information (terminations, conflicts)

**3. Reference Manipulation**
- Providing friends/family as "supervisors"
- Coaching references on what to say
- Falsifying contact information

**Detection Techniques:**

**A. Behavioral Observation**
- Inconsistent body language
- Excessive fidgeting or nervousness
- Avoiding eye contact
- Defensive responses
- Overly rehearsed answers

**Caution:** These signs may also indicate normal interview anxiety; use cautiously.

**B. Detailed Probing**
- Ask for specific details (dates, names, numbers)
- Request examples beyond prepared responses
- Probe inconsistencies
- "Tell me more about..." questions

**C. Cross-Checking**
- Compare resume to application form
- Verify dates and facts across documents
- Multiple interviewers ask about same experiences
- Reference checks for verification

**D. Technical Assessment**
- Practical tests for claimed skills
- Job-specific knowledge questions
- Problem-solving demonstrations

**E. Background Verification**
- Education verification with institutions
- Employment verification with HR departments
- Professional license/certification checks
- Criminal background checks (where legal)

**Example Detection:**

**Interviewer:** "You mentioned leading a team of 15 in implementing the ERP system. Tell me about the specific challenges you faced with team dynamics."

**Candidate:** [Vague response without specifics]

**Interviewer:** "Can you name two or three team members and describe their roles?"

**Candidate:** [Struggles to provide names or roles]

**Red Flag:** Likely exaggerated or fabricated leadership claim.

### 4.16.4 Legal and Ethical Issues

**Prohibited Topics (Bangladesh Context):**

While Bangladesh labor law is less prescriptive than some countries on interview questions, ethical employers avoid:

| **Topic** | **Why Problematic** | **Alternative Approach** |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Age** | Potential age discrimination | Focus on experience and energy for job demands |
| **Marital Status** | Gender discrimination risk | If travel required: "This position requires 40% travel. Is this acceptable?" |
| **Children/Family Plans** | Gender discrimination | Discuss job requirements, not family situation |
| **Religion** | Discriminatory | Don't ask about religious practices unless BFOQ |
| **Disability** | Discriminatory | After conditional offer: "Can you perform these essential functions with or without accommodation?" |
| **National Origin** | Discriminatory | If language needed: "This position requires fluent English. Are you comfortable with this?" |
| **Political Affiliation** | Privacy violation | Don't ask unless directly job-related (political role) |
| **Financial Status** | Privacy; limited relevance | Only for positions with fiduciary responsibility, done through background check |

**Best Practice:** Every question should pass the test: "Is this job-related and necessary for assessing candidate's ability to perform?"

## 4.19 Review Questions

### **Conceptual Understanding:**

1. Distinguish between recruitment and selection. Why are both processes necessary for effective staffing?

2. Explain how internal and external recruitment sources complement each other. When should organizations prioritize each?

3. Define reliability and validity in the context of selection testing. Can a test be reliable but not valid? Explain with examples.

4. What is the "first impression bias" in interviewing? How does it affect hiring decisions, and what strategies can mitigate it?

5. Explain the STAR method in behavioral interviewing. Why is this technique considered superior to traditional interview questions?

### **Application and Analysis:**

6. You are the HR Manager of a growing e-commerce company in Bangladesh. Design a comprehensive recruitment strategy for hiring 20 software developers within three months. Include sources, channels, timeline, and budget considerations.

7. Develop a structured interview guide for a "Branch Manager" position at a commercial bank. Include at least 10 questions covering different competencies, with rating scales and follow-up probes.

8. A company discovers that their employment test, while reliable (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.85), shows adverse impact against female candidates (female pass rate = 45%, male pass rate = 70%). As HR Director, what steps would you take to address this situation?

9. Compare and contrast behavioral and situational interview techniques. For what types of positions might each be more appropriate?

10. Design a validation study to demonstrate that your organization's selection process predicts job performance. Outline the methodology, data collection procedures, and analysis approach.

### **Critical Thinking:**

11. "Social media recruitment is more effective than traditional newspaper advertisements for all positions." Critically evaluate this statement with reference to different job levels and demographics.

12. Some argue that personality tests should not be used in selection because they can be faked and have limited predictive validity. Others believe they provide valuable insights into cultural fit. Where do you stand on this debate? Justify your position.

13. Evaluate the ethical implications of using AI-powered resume screening tools. What are the potential benefits and risks? How can organizations ensure fairness?

14. "Structured interviews, while more valid, create impersonal candidate experiences that damage employer brand." Discuss this tension and propose strategies to maintain both validity and positive candidate experience.

15. In Bangladesh's context, what specific cultural and legal considerations should organizations keep in mind when designing recruitment and selection processes? How might practices differ from Western approaches?

## 4.20 Case Study: Transforming Recruitment and Selection at TechVenture Bangladesh

**Background:**

TechVenture Bangladesh is a software development firm with 180 employees, providing custom software solutions to local and international clients. Founded in 2015, the company experienced rapid growth but recently faced challenges:

- **High Turnover:** 35% annual turnover, particularly among developers (18-month average tenure)
- **Quality Concerns:** 40% of new hires underperform in first year
- **Lengthy Hiring:** Average 90 days to fill developer positions
- **Poor Candidate Experience:** 3.2/5.0 rating on Glassdoor for interview process
- **Diversity Gap:** Only 12% female employees despite 30% female Computer Science graduates

The CEO commissioned HR Director Farah Ahmed to overhaul recruitment and selection processes.

**Current State Analysis:**

Farah's diagnosis revealed significant problems:

**Recruitment Issues:**
- Reliance solely on job boards (bdjobs.com, BDCareers.com)
- Generic job postings not highlighting company strengths
- No employer branding strategy
- Limited university relationships
- No employee referral program
- Reactive recruitment (posting only when vacancies exist)

**Selection Issues:**
- Unstructured interviews with different questions for each candidate
- Technical assessment focusing on theoretical knowledge, not practical skills
- Single interviewer (hiring manager) making all decisions
- No validation of selection methods
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria
- References rarely checked
- Fast hiring pressure leading to compromises

**Outcomes:**
- Hiring developers lacking practical coding skills
- Cultural misfits causing team conflicts
- Candidates accepting offers then declining before start date
- Negative word-of-mouth affecting talent attraction

**Transformation Initiative:**

Farah proposed comprehensive 12-month transformation:

**Phase 1: Employer Branding and Recruitment Marketing (Months 1-3)**

**Note to Students:**

Recruitment and selection are where HR strategy becomes tangible—where organizations acquire the human capital that determines competitive success or failure. Master these processes not as administrative tasks but as strategic imperatives requiring analytical rigor, behavioral insight, ethical judgment, and continuous improvement.

The future belongs to organizations that can attract, identify, and select talent more effectively than competitors. As HR professionals, your expertise in these areas will directly impact organizational performance, employee careers, and ultimately, societal outcomes through employment opportunity creation.

**Prepare thoughtfully, practice deliberately, and commit to excellence in talent acquisition!**
