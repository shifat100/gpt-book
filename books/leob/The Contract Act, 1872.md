# Chapter 1: The Contract Act, 1872

## Introduction

The **Contract Act, 1872** is one of the oldest and most fundamental laws governing commercial transactions in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Originally enacted during the British colonial period, this Act continues to serve as the primary legislation regulating contractual relationships in Bangladesh. Understanding contract law is essential for business students, as contracts form the backbone of virtually all commercial activities—from simple purchase transactions to complex multinational business agreements.

A contract creates legally enforceable obligations between parties, providing certainty and predictability in business dealings. This chapter explores the fundamental principles of contract law, including formation, validity, performance, and discharge of contracts, as well as special types of contracts that are particularly relevant to business operations.

## 1. Definition of a Contract

### What is a Contract?

According to **Section 2(h)** of the Contract Act, 1872:

> "An agreement enforceable by law is a contract."

This simple definition contains two crucial elements:
- There must be an **agreement** between parties
- The agreement must be **enforceable by law**

### The Formula of a Contract

**Agreement = Offer + Acceptance**

**Contract = Agreement + Enforceability**

Therefore: **Contract = Agreement Enforceable by Law**

### Essential Elements of a Valid Contract

For an agreement to become a valid and enforceable contract, the following essential elements must be present:

#### 1. **Offer and Acceptance**
- There must be a clear offer made by one party (the **offeror**)
- The offer must be accepted unconditionally by another party (the **offeree**)
- Both offer and acceptance must be communicated

#### 2. **Intention to Create Legal Relations**
- The parties must intend that their agreement should create legal obligations
- Social and domestic agreements are generally presumed not to create legal relations
- Commercial agreements are presumed to create legal relations

#### 3. **Lawful Consideration**
- Something of value must be exchanged between the parties
- Consideration must be lawful, real, and not illusory
- As per **Section 2(d)**, consideration may be past, present, or future

#### 4. **Capacity of Parties**
- The parties entering into the contract must be competent to contract
- This includes being of sound mind, of the age of majority, and not disqualified by law

#### 5. **Free Consent**
- The consent of the parties must be free and genuine
- Consent obtained through coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake is not free consent

#### 6. **Lawful Object**
- The purpose and object of the contract must be lawful
- It must not be forbidden by law, immoral, or opposed to public policy

#### 7. **Not Expressly Declared Void**
- The agreement must not be one that has been expressly declared void by the Contract Act or any other law

#### 8. **Certainty and Possibility of Performance**
- The terms of the contract must be certain and not vague
- The contract must be capable of being performed

#### 9. **Legal Formalities**
- Where required by law, the contract must comply with necessary formalities such as writing, registration, or attestation

---

## 2. Formation of a Contract

The formation of a valid contract involves three fundamental stages: **Offer**, **Acceptance**, and **Consideration**.

### 2.1 Offer (Proposal)

#### Definition

According to **Section 2(a)**: "When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal."

The person making the offer is called the **proposer** or **offeror**, and the person to whom it is made is called the **offeree**.

#### Essential Elements of a Valid Offer

**1. Intention to Create Legal Relations**
- The offer must be made with the intention of creating legal obligations
- Mere statements of intention, invitations to treat, or social invitations are not offers

**2. Definite and Certain Terms**
- The terms of the offer must be clear, definite, and certain
- Vague offers cannot be accepted to form a valid contract

**3. Communication**
- The offer must be communicated to the offeree
- An offer cannot be accepted unless it is known to the offeree

**4. Distinguished from Invitation to Treat**
- An **invitation to treat** is an invitation to others to make offers
- Examples include: display of goods in shops, advertisements, catalogs, price lists, and auction announcements

#### Types of Offers

**1. Express Offer**
- Made in words, either spoken or written
- Example: "I offer to sell my car to you for Tk. 500,000"

**2. Implied Offer**
- Made by conduct or circumstances
- Example: A taxi driver plying for hire makes an implied offer to transport passengers

**3. General Offer**
- Made to the world at large rather than to a specific person
- Can be accepted by anyone who fulfills the conditions
- Example: In **Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.**, the company offered £100 to anyone who used their product as directed and still contracted influenza

**4. Specific Offer**
- Made to a specific person or group
- Only the person(s) to whom it is made can accept it

**5. Cross Offer**
- When two parties make identical offers to each other in ignorance of each other's offer
- Cross offers do not constitute acceptance and therefore no contract is formed

**6. Counter Offer**
- An offer made in response to an original offer that modifies its terms
- A counter offer rejects the original offer

#### Termination of an Offer

An offer may be terminated in the following ways:

**1. Revocation (Withdrawal)**
- By communication of notice of revocation by the offeror before acceptance
- By lapse of time (if a time limit was specified)
- By death or insanity of the offeror (if known to the offeree before acceptance)

**2. Rejection**
- Express rejection by the offeree
- Implied rejection by making a counter offer

**3. Non-fulfillment of Conditions**
- Failure to accept within the prescribed time or manner
- Non-fulfillment of a condition precedent to acceptance

**4. By Operation of Law**
- Subsequent illegality or destruction of the subject matter

---

### 2.2 Acceptance

#### Definition

According to **Section 2(b)**: "When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise."

#### Essential Elements of a Valid Acceptance

**1. Absolute and Unconditional**
- Acceptance must be in exact terms of the offer
- A conditional or qualified acceptance is a counter offer, not an acceptance

**2. Expressed in Usual and Reasonable Manner**
- Acceptance may be express (words) or implied (conduct)
- Must be communicated in the manner prescribed or, if none prescribed, in a usual and reasonable manner

**3. Made by the Person to Whom the Offer is Made**
- Only the offeree or their authorized agent can accept
- Third parties cannot accept an offer

**4. Must be Communicated**
- Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror
- Mental acceptance without communication is not valid
- Exception: General offers can be accepted by performing the conditions

**5. Before Revocation**
- Acceptance must be given before the offer is revoked or lapses

**6. Within Prescribed or Reasonable Time**
- If a time limit is specified, acceptance must be within that time
- If no time is specified, acceptance must be within a reasonable time

**7. Must Follow the Prescribed Mode**
- If a specific mode of acceptance is prescribed, it must be followed
- If no mode is prescribed, any reasonable and usual mode is acceptable

#### Communication of Acceptance

According to **Section 4**, communication of acceptance is:
- **Complete as against the proposer**: When it is put in a course of transmission so that it is out of the power of the acceptor
- **Complete as against the acceptor**: When it comes to the knowledge of the proposer

#### Silence as Acceptance

- Mere silence cannot constitute acceptance
- The offeror cannot impose acceptance by stating "if I hear nothing from you, I shall assume you accept"
- However, silence coupled with conduct indicating acceptance may be valid

---

### 2.3 Consideration

#### Definition

According to **Section 2(d)**: "When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

In simple terms, **consideration** is something of value given by one party in exchange for the promise or performance of the other party. It is the "price" for the promise.

#### Essential Elements of Consideration

**1. At the Desire of the Promisor**
- The act must be done at the request or desire of the promisor
- Voluntary acts done without request do not constitute consideration

**2. May Move from the Promisee or Any Other Person**
- In English law, consideration must move from the promisee
- In Bangladesh (and Indian) law, consideration may move from the promisee or any other person (**Section 2(d)**)

**3. May be Past, Present, or Future**
- **Past consideration**: Act done before the promise
- **Present consideration** (Executed): Act done simultaneously with the promise
- **Future consideration** (Executory): Promise to do something in the future

**4. Need Not be Adequate but Must be Real**
- Courts do not question the adequacy of consideration
- However, consideration must have some value in the eyes of law
- It cannot be illusory or impossible

**5. Must be Lawful**
- Consideration must not be illegal, immoral, or opposed to public policy

#### Types of Consideration

**1. Executed Consideration (Present)**
- One party performs their obligation at the time of the contract
- Example: Cash sale where goods are delivered and payment is made immediately

**2. Executory Consideration (Future)**
- Both parties promise to perform their obligations in the future
- Example: A agrees to supply goods to B next month, and B agrees to pay upon delivery

**3. Past Consideration**
- An act done before the promise is made
- Example: A renders services to B. Later, B promises to pay A for those services

#### Exceptions to the Rule of Consideration

**Section 25** provides three exceptions where an agreement is valid even without consideration:

**1. Natural Love and Affection (Section 25(1))**
- Agreement must be in writing and registered
- Must be between parties standing in a near relation
- Must be made out of natural love and affection

**2. Voluntary Compensation for Past Acts (Section 25(2))**
- A promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor
- Example: A finds B's lost goods and returns them. B promises to pay A Tk. 5,000 as a reward

**3. Promise to Pay Time-Barred Debt (Section 25(3))**
- A promise in writing and signed to pay a time-barred debt
- The debt must have been previously enforceable but is now barred by the law of limitation

**4. Completed Gift (Section 25, Explanation 1)**
- No consideration is necessary to create an agency

**5. Agency (Section 185)**
- No consideration is required to create a contract of agency

**6. Charitable Subscriptions**
- Promises to contribute to charitable causes may be enforceable without consideration in certain circumstances

#### Stranger to Consideration vs. Stranger to Contract

- **Stranger to Consideration**: A person who has not provided consideration but is a party to the contract (allowed under Bangladesh law)
- **Stranger to Contract**: A person who is not a party to the contract cannot sue (principle of privity of contract)

---

## 3. Types of Agreements

Not all agreements are contracts. Some agreements may be **void** from the beginning, while others may be **voidable** at the option of one party.

### 3.1 Void Agreements

#### Definition

According to **Section 2(g)**: "An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void."

A **void agreement** has no legal effect from the very beginning. It is a nullity and cannot be enforced by any party.

#### Types of Void Agreements

**1. Agreement by a Person of Unsound Mind (Section 11)**
- Agreements made by persons of unsound mind are void
- Example: A, who is suffering from severe mental illness, agrees to sell his property. The agreement is void.

**2. Agreement by a Minor (Section 11)**
- Agreements by or with minors are void ab initio
- A minor cannot enter into a valid contract
- However, a minor's agreement can be ratified after attaining majority if it was for necessaries

**3. Agreement Made Under Mutual Mistake of Fact (Section 20)**
- When both parties are mistaken about a matter of fact essential to the agreement
- Example: A agrees to buy B's horse. Unknown to both, the horse has died. The agreement is void.

**4. Agreement with Unlawful Consideration or Object (Section 23)**
- If the consideration or object is unlawful, the agreement is void
- Example: A agrees to pay B Tk. 100,000 to injure C. The agreement is void as the object is unlawful.

**5. Agreement in Restraint of Marriage (Section 26)**
- Every agreement in restraint of marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void
- Example: A agrees not to marry anyone in consideration of B paying him Tk. 500,000. The agreement is void.

**6. Agreement in Restraint of Trade (Section 27)**
- Every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business is void
- Exception: Sale of goodwill with reasonable restrictions
- Example: A sells his business to B and agrees never to carry on a similar business anywhere. This is void unless reasonably restricted.

**7. Agreement in Restraint of Legal Proceedings (Section 28)**
- Every agreement restricting the enforcement of rights through courts is void
- Exception: Arbitration agreements are valid

**8. Agreements with Uncertain Meaning (Section 29)**
- Agreements that are not capable of being made certain are void
- Example: A agrees to sell "a quantity" of rice to B. The agreement is void due to uncertainty.

**9. Agreements by Way of Wager (Section 30)**
- Wagering agreements are void
- A **wager** is an agreement between two parties under which money or other value is payable on the happening or non-happening of an uncertain future event
- Example: A and B bet Tk. 10,000 on which team will win a cricket match. This is void.

**10. Agreements Contingent on Impossible Events (Section 36)**
- If an agreement is contingent on an impossible event, it is void
- Example: A agrees to pay B Tk. 100,000 if B can touch the sky with his hand. This is void.

---

### 3.2 Voidable Agreements (Voidable Contracts)

#### Definition

According to **Section 2(i)**: "An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties thereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a voidable contract."

A **voidable contract** is valid and enforceable unless and until the aggrieved party chooses to avoid it. It remains binding on both parties unless the party with the option decides to rescind it.

#### Grounds for Voidability

**1. Coercion (Section 15)**
- When consent is obtained by coercion, the contract is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so obtained
- Example: A threatens to harm B's son unless B sells his property to A at an undervalue. B can avoid the contract.

**2. Undue Influence (Section 16)**
- When the consent is obtained by undue influence, the contract is voidable
- Example: A lawyer uses his dominant position to get his elderly client to transfer property at an undervalue. The client can avoid the contract.

**3. Fraud (Section 17)**
- When consent is obtained by fraud, the contract is voidable at the option of the party defrauded
- The aggrieved party may also insist on performance if they so choose
- Example: A sells a car to B claiming it has never been in an accident, knowing this to be false. B can avoid the contract.

**4. Misrepresentation (Section 18)**
- When consent is caused by innocent misrepresentation, the contract is voidable
- Example: A genuinely but mistakenly tells B that a painting is an original, and B buys it. B can avoid the contract when he discovers the truth.

**5. Contingent Contract Becoming Void (Section 32)**
- A contingent contract to do or not to do something if an uncertain future event does not happen can be enforced only if the event becomes impossible

#### Key Differences: Void vs. Voidable Agreements

| **Aspect** | **Void Agreement** | **Voidable Contract** |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Validity** | Void from the beginning | Valid until avoided |
| **Enforceability** | Not enforceable at all | Enforceable until rescinded |
| **Option** | Neither party can enforce | One party has the option to avoid |
| **Collateral Transactions** | All related transactions are void | Valid unless the main contract is avoided |
| **Examples** | Agreement with a minor, wagering agreement | Contract induced by coercion, fraud, or undue influence |

---

## 4. Capacity of Parties

For an agreement to be a valid contract, the parties must be **competent to contract**. Contractual capacity refers to the legal ability of a person to enter into a binding contract.

### 4.1 Who is Competent to Contract?

According to **Section 11**: "Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject."

Therefore, a person is competent to contract if:
1. They have attained the **age of majority**
2. They are of **sound mind**
3. They are **not disqualified** by any law

### 4.2 Minors (Persons Below the Age of Majority)

#### Who is a Minor?

Under the **Majority Act, 1875** (applicable in Bangladesh):
- A person is a minor until they complete **18 years of age**
- Exception: If a guardian has been appointed or property has been placed under the superintendence of the Court of Wards, the person remains a minor until **21 years of age**

#### Position of Minor's Agreements

- **Minor's agreements are void ab initio** (void from the beginning)
- A minor cannot enter into a valid contract
- A minor cannot sue or be sued on a contract
- Even if a minor fraudulently represents himself as a major, the contract remains void

#### Landmark Case: Mohori Bibee vs. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)

This Privy Council case established the principle that:
- A minor's agreement is absolutely void
- Even if the minor misrepresents his age, he cannot be compelled to perform the contract
- Money or property obtained by a minor cannot be recovered if it has been spent or disposed of

#### Exceptions and Special Provisions Regarding Minors

**1. Contract for Necessaries (Section 68)**
- A minor cannot be made personally liable for contracts
- However, if necessaries are supplied to a minor or to someone whom the minor is legally bound to support, the supplier can recover the price from the minor's property (not personally)
- **Necessaries** include food, clothing, lodging, education, and medical treatment suitable to the minor's station in life

**2. Minor as Beneficiary**
- A minor can be a beneficiary under a contract
- Example: A minor can receive gifts or benefits under a trust

**3. Minor as Agent (Section 184)**
- A minor can act as an agent
- However, the minor is not personally responsible to the principal

**4. Partnership**
- A minor cannot be a partner in a partnership
- However, with the consent of all partners, a minor can be admitted to the benefits of partnership

### 4.3 Persons of Unsound Mind

#### Definition (Section 12)

"A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract, if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests."

A person who cannot understand the contract or form a rational judgment is of unsound mind.

#### Categories of Unsound Mind

**1. Idiots**
- Persons who have been of unsound mind from birth
- Their agreements are always void

**2. Lunatics**
- Persons who suffer from mental illness or insanity
- During lucid intervals (periods of soundness), they can contract validly
- Contracts made during periods of insanity are void

**3. Drunken or Intoxicated Persons**
- Agreements made while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are voidable if the person was incapable of understanding the nature of the agreement
- If the person has voluntarily intoxicated themselves, the position is less clear, but generally contracts may still be voidable

#### Liability for Necessaries (Section 68)

- Similar to minors, persons of unsound mind are liable from their property (not personally) for necessaries supplied to them or their dependents

### 4.4 Disqualified Persons

Certain persons are disqualified from contracting by specific laws:

**1. Alien Enemies**
- Persons who are citizens of a country at war with Bangladesh
- Cannot contract with Bangladeshi citizens during wartime
- Contracts made before the war may be suspended or dissolved

**2. Foreign Sovereigns and Ambassadors**
- Cannot be sued in Bangladeshi courts without consent of the government
- This affects enforceability of contracts

**3. Convicts**
- Persons convicted and undergoing imprisonment may have limited capacity
- During imprisonment, they cannot enter into certain contracts

**4. Insolvents (Undischarged)**
- Persons declared insolvent cannot enter into contracts until discharged from insolvency
- Their property vests in the Official Receiver/Assignee

**5. Corporate Bodies**
- Companies can only enter into contracts within the scope of their objectives as stated in the Memorandum of Association
- Contracts beyond their powers (ultra vires) are void

---

## 5. Free Consent

Consent is fundamental to the formation of a contract. However, not all consent is valid. For a contract to be enforceable, the consent of the parties must be **free consent**.

### 5.1 Definition of Consent and Free Consent

#### Consent (Section 13)

"Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."

This is also called **consensus ad idem** (meeting of minds).

#### Free Consent (Section 14)

"Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by:
1. **Coercion** (Section 15)
2. **Undue influence** (Section 16)
3. **Fraud** (Section 17)
4. **Misrepresentation** (Section 18)
5. **Mistake** (Section 20, 21, 22)"

When consent is not free, the contract may be voidable or void depending on the vitiating factor.

---

### 5.2 Coercion (Section 15)

#### Definition

**Coercion** is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Bangladesh Penal Code, or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.

#### Essential Elements

1. Committing or threatening to commit an act forbidden by law
2. Unlawful detention or threat of detention of property
3. Intention to cause a person to enter into a contract
4. The act need not be directed against the contracting party (can be against any person)

#### Examples

- A threatens to file a false criminal case against B unless B sells his property to A at a throwaway price
- A detains B's goods unlawfully and refuses to return them unless B enters into a contract with A
- A threatens to harm B's child unless B agrees to A's terms

#### Effect of Coercion

- The contract is **voidable** at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by coercion (Section 19)
- The aggrieved party may:
  - **Rescind** (cancel) the contract, or
  - **Affirm** the contract and insist on performance

#### Burden of Proof

- The person alleging coercion must prove it
- However, the circumstances may create a presumption of coercion in certain relationships

---

### 5.3 Undue Influence (Section 16)

#### Definition

A contract is said to be induced by **undue influence** where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.

#### When Undue Influence is Presumed (Section 16(2))

The law presumes undue influence in the following relationships:
1. Where the person holds a **real or apparent authority** over the other
2. Where the person stands in a **fiduciary relationship** to the other
3. Where the person makes a contract with someone whose **mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected** by age, illness, or mental or bodily distress

#### Examples of Relationships Where Undue Influence is Presumed

- Parent and child
- Guardian and ward
- Trustee and beneficiary
- Doctor and patient
- Lawyer and client
- Spiritual advisor and devotee
- Teacher and student

**Note**: The relationship of husband and wife does not automatically raise a presumption of undue influence.

#### Essential Elements

1. A dominant and subservient relationship exists
2. The dominant party uses their position to obtain an unfair advantage
3. There is no independent advice or adequate consideration

#### Examples

- A doctor persuades his elderly patient to gift him a valuable property
- A spiritual guru influences his devotee to transfer all assets to the guru's trust
- A lawyer uses confidential information to purchase his client's property at an undervalue

#### Effect of Undue Influence

- The contract is **voidable** at the option of the party whose consent was influenced (Section 19A)
- The aggrieved party may avoid the contract
- The court may set aside the contract or modify its terms

#### Burden of Proof

- In relationships where undue influence is presumed, the burden is on the dominant party to prove that the transaction was fair and voluntary
- In other cases, the party alleging undue influence must prove it

---

### 5.4 Fraud (Section 17)

#### Definition

**Fraud** means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:

1. The **suggestion as a fact** of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true
2. The **active concealment** of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact
3. A **promise made without any intention** of performing it
4. Any other act fitted to deceive
5. Any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent

#### Essential Elements

1. **False representation** of fact (not opinion or law)
2. **Knowledge of falsity** or belief that it is false, or recklessness
3. **Intention to deceive** the other party
4. The false statement must actually **deceive** the other party
5. The deceived party must suffer **damage or prejudice**

#### Examples

- A sells a car to B, falsely claiming it has never been in an accident, knowing it was badly damaged in a collision
- A promises to marry B in order to induce B to transfer property, with no intention of performing the promise
- A conceals material defects in property sold to B, knowing of the defects

#### What Does Not Amount to Fraud?

- **Mere silence** does not amount to fraud unless there is a duty to speak
- Statements of **opinion** or **puffery** in trade (mere praise of goods)
- **Dolus boni** (permissible exaggeration in trade): "This is the best quality"

#### Duty to Disclose

Silence amounts to fraud in the following circumstances:
- Where the circumstances create a duty to speak
- In contracts of **uberrimae fidei** (utmost good faith), such as insurance contracts
- Where silence itself is equivalent to speech
- Where the party has special knowledge that the other party cannot discover

#### Effect of Fraud

When consent is obtained by fraud, the contract is **voidable** at the option of the party defrauded (Section 19). The aggrieved party may:
1. **Rescind** (avoid) the contract, or
2. **Affirm** the contract and insist on performance

Additionally, the party defrauded may claim **damages** for any loss suffered.

#### Exception (Section 19)

If the party whose consent was obtained by fraud had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence, the contract is not voidable.

---

### 5.5 Misrepresentation (Section 18)

#### Definition

**Misrepresentation** means and includes:

1. The **positive assertion**, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true
2. Any **breach of duty** which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person committing it, or anyone claiming under him, by misleading another to his prejudice
3. Causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement

#### Essential Elements

1. False representation of fact
2. Made innocently (without knowledge of its falsity)
3. With the belief that it is true
4. Which induces the other party to contract

#### Fraud vs. Misrepresentation

| **Aspect** | **Fraud** | **Misrepresentation** |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Intent** | Intent to deceive | No intent to deceive |
| **Knowledge** | Knowledge of falsity | Innocent mistake |
| **Remedies** | Rescission + Damages | Rescission only |
| **Good Faith** | Absence of good faith | Made in good faith |

#### Examples of Misrepresentation

- A sells land to B, honestly but mistakenly stating that it measures 5 acres when it actually measures only 4 acres
- A sells a painting to B as an "original," genuinely believing it to be so, but it turns out to be a copy

#### Effect of Misrepresentation

The contract is **voidable** at the option of the party whose consent was caused by misrepresentation (Section 19). However:
- The aggrieved party **cannot claim damages** (unlike in fraud)
- The aggrieved party can only **rescind** the contract

---

### 5.6 Mistake

Mistake refers to an erroneous belief about something. A mistake may be:
1. **Mistake of Law**
2. **Mistake of Fact**

#### 5.6.1 Mistake of Law

Mistake of law can be of two types:

**1. Mistake of Law of the Country (Section 21)**
- "A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Bangladesh."
- **Ignorantia juris non excusat** (ignorance of law is no excuse)
- Effect: The contract is valid and binding

**2. Mistake of Foreign Law (Section 21)**
- A mistake as to a law not in force in Bangladesh has the same effect as a mistake of fact
- Foreign law is treated as a question of fact
- Effect: The contract may be void if it is a mistake of fact essential to the agreement

#### 5.6.2 Mistake of Fact

Mistake of fact can be:

**A. Bilateral Mistake (Mutual Mistake)**

When both parties to an agreement are mistaken about a matter of fact essential to the agreement.

**Types of Bilateral Mistake:**

**1. Mistake as to the Subject Matter (Section 20)**

**(i) Mistake as to the Existence of Subject Matter**
- When both parties believe that the subject matter exists, but it has ceased to exist
- Effect: The agreement is **void**
- Example: A agrees to buy B's horse, but unknown to both, the horse has died. The agreement is void.

**(ii) Mistake as to the Identity of Subject Matter**
- When the parties are at cross-purposes about what is being contracted
- Effect: The agreement is **void**
- Example: A offers to sell his car registration number DM-1234, but B thinks A is selling car DM-4321. No contract exists.

**(iii) Mistake as to the Quality of Subject Matter**
- Generally, mistake as to quality does not make the contract void unless the mistake relates to the very substance of the contract
- Effect: Usually the contract is **valid**

**(iv) Mistake as to the Quantity of Subject Matter**
- If both parties are mistaken about the quantity and this is fundamental to the contract
- Effect: The agreement may be **void**

**2. Mistake as to the Possibility of Performance**
- When the contract is impossible to perform, but both parties believe it is possible
- Effect: The agreement is **void**
- Example: A agrees to marry B, but unknown to both, B is already married. The agreement is void as polygamy is illegal.

**B. Unilateral Mistake**

When only one party is mistaken.

**General Rule**: A unilateral mistake does not affect the validity of the contract.

**Exceptions** (when unilateral mistake makes the contract void):

**1. Mistake as to the Identity of Person**
- When the identity of the contracting party is material to the contract
- Effect: The agreement is **void**
- Example: A intends to contract with B (a solvent person) but mistakenly contracts with C (who fraudulently impersonates B). The contract is void.

**2. Mistake as to the Nature of the Contract**
- When a person is mistaken about the very nature of the contract due to fraud or misrepresentation
- This is called **non est factum** (it is not my deed)
- Effect: The contract is **void**

#### Effect of Mistake

| **Type of Mistake** | **Effect** |
|-------------------|----------|
| Mistake of Law of Bangladesh | Valid contract |
| Mistake of Foreign Law | Void (treated as mistake of fact) |
| Bilateral Mistake of Fact | Void |
| Unilateral Mistake (general) | Valid |
| Unilateral Mistake (identity/nature) | Void |

---

## 6. Legality of Object and Consideration

For a contract to be valid, both the **object** (purpose) and **consideration** must be lawful.

### 6.1 When Consideration and Object are Unlawful (Section 23)

The consideration or object of an agreement is **unlawful** if it is:

#### 1. Forbidden by Law
- Any consideration or object that is prohibited by any statute
- Example: An agreement to smuggle contraband goods is void as it is forbidden by customs law

#### 2. Of Such a Nature That, If Permitted, It Would Defeat the Provisions of Any Law
- Agreements that circumvent the law
- Example: An agreement to pay money to a public servant to show favor in the discharge of his official duties (bribery) defeats anti-corruption laws

#### 3. Fraudulent
- Agreements made with the intention to defraud others
- Example: A and B agree to falsely represent to C that A's property is free from encumbrances when it is actually mortgaged

#### 4. Involves or Implies Injury to the Person or Property of Another
- Agreements that cause harm to others
- Example: A agrees to pay B to assault C

#### 5. Immoral
- Agreements that are opposed to public morality
- Example: An agreement for prostitution or an agreement in consideration of future illicit cohabitation

#### 6. Opposed to Public Policy
- Agreements that are against the interest of the public or the welfare of society

**Agreements Opposed to Public Policy Include:**

**a. Trading with Enemy**
- Agreements with citizens of a country at war with Bangladesh

**b. Agreements Interfering with Administration of Justice**
- Agreements to stifle prosecution
- Agreements to suppress evidence
- Maintenance and champerty (supporting litigation in return for a share of proceeds)

**c. Agreements Interfering with Marital Duties**
- Agreements that interfere with parental duties
- Agreements for marriage brokerage

**d. Agreements in Restraint of Marriage (Section 26)**
- Every agreement in restraint of marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void

**e. Agreements in Restraint of Trade (Section 27)**
- Every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business is void
- **Exception**: Sale of goodwill of a business with reasonable restrictions

**f. Agreements in Restraint of Legal Proceedings (Section 28)**
- Every agreement that restricts the enforcement of legal rights through courts is void
- **Exception**: Agreements to refer disputes to arbitration

**g. Agreements Creating Uncertainty (Section 29)**
- Agreements that are vague or not capable of being made certain

**h. Wagering Agreements (Section 30)**
- Betting or gambling contracts

### 6.2 Effect of Unlawful Object or Consideration

- The agreement is **void** (Section 23)
- No rights or obligations arise from such an agreement
- Money paid or property transferred cannot be recovered (in pari delicto principle)

### 6.3 Agreement Collateral to Void Agreement (Section 23, Proviso)

- If the main agreement is void, then agreements collateral to it are also void
- Exception: If the collateral agreement is independent and can stand on its own, it may be valid

---

## 7. Contingent Contracts

### 7.1 Definition (Section 31)

A **contingent contract** is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen.

In simple terms, it is a contract where the performance depends on the happening or non-happening of a specified uncertain future event.

#### Essential Elements

1. Performance is conditional on an **uncertain future event**
2. The event is **collateral** (incidental) to the contract
3. The event is not a mere **will of the promisor**

#### Examples

- A promises to pay B Tk. 100,000 if B's house is destroyed by fire (insurance contract)
- A promises to sell his car to B if A buys a new car next month
- A agrees to pay B Tk. 50,000 if it rains on a particular day

### 7.2 Contingent Contract vs. Wagering Agreement

| **Aspect** | **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Nature** | Legitimate contract | Void agreement |
| **Interest** | Parties have real interest in the subject matter | Parties have no real interest except winning |
| **Purpose** | Risk management or legitimate business | Pure speculation or gambling |
| **Examples** | Insurance contracts | Betting on sports events |

### 7.3 Rules Regarding Contingent Contracts

#### Rule 1: Contingent on Happening of Event (Section 32)

If the contract is contingent on the happening of an uncertain future event:
- The contract cannot be enforced until the event happens
- If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes void

**Example**: A agrees to pay B Tk. 500,000 if B marries C. The contract can only be enforced if B marries C. If C dies before marriage, the contract becomes void.

#### Rule 2: Contingent on Non-Happening of Event (Section 33)

If the contract is contingent on an uncertain future event not happening:
- The contract can be enforced when the event becomes impossible
- The contract cannot be enforced as long as the event is still possible

**Example**: A agrees to pay B Tk. 100,000 if B's ship does not return. The contract can be enforced only if the ship sinks or is otherwise lost.

#### Rule 3: Contingent on Future Conduct (Section 34)

If the contract is contingent on how a person will act at an unspecified future time:
- The contract cannot be enforced if that person does anything that makes the event impossible

**Example**: A agrees to pay B Tk. 200,000 if B marries C. If B marries someone else, the contract becomes void.

#### Rule 4: Contingent on Specified Event Within Fixed Time (Section 35)

If the contract is contingent on a specified event happening within a fixed time:
- The contract becomes void if the time expires without the event happening
- The contract also becomes void if, before the expiry of the time, the event becomes impossible

**Example**: A promises to pay B Tk. 100,000 if a certain ship arrives within one year. If the ship does not arrive within one year, or if it sinks within the year, the contract becomes void.

#### Rule 5: Contingent on Specified Event Not Happening Within Fixed Time (Section 35)

If the contract is contingent on a specified event not happening within a fixed time:
- The contract can be enforced when the time expires without the event happening
- The contract can also be enforced if, before the expiry of the time, the event becomes impossible

#### Rule 6: Contingent on Impossible Event (Section 36)

Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens are void, whether or not the impossibility is known to the parties.

**Example**: A agrees to pay B Tk. 500,000 if B can fly without any equipment. This is void as the event is impossible.

---

## 8. Performance and Discharge of Contracts

Once a valid contract is formed, the parties are bound to perform their respective obligations. This section deals with the rules regarding performance and the various ways in which contracts can be discharged.

### 8.1 Performance of Contracts

#### Who Must Perform? (Sections 37-40)

**1. Promisor Himself (Section 40)**
- If the contract requires personal skill or involves personal confidence, it must be performed by the promisor himself
- Example: A famous artist's contract to paint a portrait must be performed by the artist personally

**2. By Agent or Legal Representatives**
- Contracts not involving personal skill can be performed by agents or legal representatives
- If the promisor dies before performance, the legal representatives must perform (unless the contract is personal)

**3. By Third Person (Section 41)**
- If a third person performs, and the promisee accepts the performance, the promisor is discharged
- However, the promisee is not bound to accept performance by a third party

**4. Joint Promisors (Section 42-45)**
- When two or more persons make a joint promise, they must perform jointly
- If one joint promisor dies, the surviving promisors must perform
- Unless there is a contract to the contrary, joint promisors may be compelled jointly or severally

#### Time and Place of Performance (Sections 46-50)

**1. Time of Performance (Section 46)**
- If a time is specified, the contract must be performed at that time
- If no time is specified, the contract must be performed within a reasonable time
- What is "reasonable" depends on the nature of the contract and circumstances

**2. "Time is of the Essence"**
- When time is expressly made essential, failure to perform on time is a breach
- In commercial contracts, time is usually of the essence
- In other contracts, time may not be of the essence unless specified

**3. Performance in Reasonable Time (Section 46)**
- Where no time is specified, performance must occur within a reasonable time and at a reasonable hour

**4. Place of Performance (Section 49)**
- If a place is specified, performance must be at that place
- If no place is specified, the promisee should apply to the promisor for reasonable facilities and instructions for performance

#### Manner of Performance (Sections 51-67)

**1. According to the Terms (Section 37)**
- Parties must perform according to the terms of the contract or according to any lawful direction of the promisee

**2. Tender of Performance (Section 38)**
- If the promisor offers to perform (tender), and the offer is refused, the promisor is not responsible for non-performance
- The promisor does not lose their rights under the contract

**3. Appropriation of Payments (Section 59-61)**
- If a debtor owes several debts and makes a payment, the payment should be appropriated according to the debtor's express intimation
- If no intimation, the creditor may appropriate
- If neither party appropriates, the law applies the payment to the earliest debt

**4. Payment by Debtor Entitled to Set-off (Section 62)**
- If a debtor owes money but the creditor also owes money to the debtor, the debtor can set-off and pay only the balance

**5. Performance of Reciprocal Promises (Sections 51-54)**
- When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be performed simultaneously, no promisor need perform unless the other is ready and willing to perform

---

### 8.2 Discharge of Contracts

A contract is said to be discharged when the rights and obligations arising from it come to an end. Contracts can be discharged in the following ways:

#### 1. Discharge by Performance

- When both parties fully and satisfactorily perform their respective obligations, the contract stands discharged
- This is the normal and intended mode of discharge

**Actual Performance**
- Complete and exact performance of contractual obligations

**Attempted Performance (Tender)**
- If one party attempts performance but the other refuses, the party making the attempt is discharged from liability

#### 2. Discharge by Agreement or Consent

Parties may mutually agree to discharge the contract. This can be done through:

**a. Novation (Section 62)**
- Substitution of a new contract for the existing one
- The new contract may be between the same parties or between different parties
- The old contract is discharged, and a new contract comes into existence

**b. Rescission**
- Mutual cancellation of the contract
- Both parties agree that the contract shall no longer bind them
- All obligations come to an end

**c. Alteration**
- Material alteration of the terms of the contract by mutual consent
- The original contract is discharged and replaced by an altered contract

**d. Remission (Section 63)**
- Acceptance of a lesser performance than what was promised
- The promisee dispenses with or promises to dispense with the performance of the promise wholly or in part
- Example: A owes B Tk. 10,000. B agrees to accept Tk. 8,000 in full satisfaction. The contract is discharged.

**e. Waiver**
- Voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right
- A party may waive their rights under the contract

**f. Merger**
- When an inferior right merges into a superior right
- Example: A written formal contract supersedes a prior oral contract on the same subject

#### 3. Discharge by Impossibility of Performance

**a. Impossibility Existing at the Time of Contract (Section 56)**
- If the contract is based on a fundamental assumption that proves to be false, the contract is void
- Example: Agreement to sell goods that unknown to both parties have already been destroyed

**b. Supervening Impossibility (Doctrine of Frustration)**
- If after the contract is made, performance becomes impossible or unlawful due to circumstances beyond the control of the parties, the contract becomes void
- This is covered under **Section 56**

**Grounds of Supervening Impossibility:**

**(i) Destruction of Subject Matter**
- Example: A agrees to let his hall to B for a function. Before the date, the hall is destroyed by fire. The contract is frustrated.

**(ii) Non-Existence or Non-Occurrence of a Particular State of Things**
- Example: A contracts to take B to view the coronation procession. The procession is cancelled. The contract may be frustrated.

**(iii) Death or Incapacity**
- Personal contracts are discharged by death or permanent incapacity of the promisor

**(iv) Change of Law or Outbreak of War**
- If the contract becomes illegal due to a change in law or war makes performance impossible

**(v) Impossibility Due to Non-Performance by Third Party**
- When the performance depends on the action of a third party and that party fails to act

**What is NOT Supervening Impossibility:**

- **Commercial impossibility** or difficulty in performance
- Increase in cost or loss of profit
- Strikes or labor problems (unless completely unforeseen)
- Failure of expected source of supply (if alternative sources exist)

#### 4. Discharge by Lapse of Time

- Under the **Limitation Act, 1908**, legal remedies for breach of contract must be sought within a prescribed period
- If the period expires, the claim becomes time-barred
- The contract is not void, but the remedy is lost
- However, a promise to pay a time-barred debt can revive the obligation (Section 25(3))

#### 5. Discharge by Breach

**a. Actual Breach**
- When one party fails to perform their obligation on the due date
- The aggrieved party can treat the contract as discharged and sue for damages

**b. Anticipatory Breach (Section 39)**
- When one party, before the time of performance, declares their intention not to perform or does an act that makes performance impossible
- The aggrieved party may:
  - Treat the contract as immediately discharged and sue for damages, or
  - Wait until the time of performance and then sue

**Example**: A contracts to supply goods to B on 1st January. On 1st December, A informs B that he will not supply the goods. This is anticipatory breach.

#### 6. Discharge by Operation of Law

Contracts may be discharged by:
- **Merger**: When an inferior right merges into a superior right
- **Insolvency**: When a person is declared insolvent, he is discharged from all debts provable in insolvency
- **Judgment of Court**: A court decree may discharge contractual obligations

---

### 8.3 Consequences of Breach of Contract

When a contract is breached, the aggrieved party is entitled to remedies.

#### Remedies for Breach of Contract

**1. Damages (Sections 73-75)**
- Monetary compensation for loss suffered due to breach
- **Ordinary damages**: Compensation for loss that naturally arises from the breach
- **Special damages**: Compensation for loss that was in the contemplation of parties at the time of contract
- **Nominal damages**: Small amount awarded when breach is proved but no actual loss is suffered
- **Exemplary/Punitive damages**: Not generally awarded in contract cases (only in tort)

**2. Specific Performance**
- Court order directing the party to perform their contractual obligations
- Available when monetary damages are inadequate
- Governed by the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**

**3. Injunction**
- Court order restraining a party from doing something contrary to the contract
- Used to enforce negative covenants
- Example: If A contracts not to compete with B, an injunction can prevent A from competing

**4. Quantum Meruit**
- Literally means "as much as is earned"
- Claim for reasonable remuneration for work already done
- Available when the contract is partly performed or when one party prevents completion

---

## 9. Special Contracts

The Contract Act, 1872 provides special rules for certain types of contracts that are commonly used in business. These include contracts of **indemnity and guarantee**, **bailment and pledge**, and **agency** (agency will be covered in a separate chapter).

### 9.1 Contract of Indemnity

#### Definition (Section 124)

"A contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person, is called a contract of indemnity."

**Parties:**

#### Essential Elements

1. Two parties: Indemnifier and Indemnified
2. Promise to compensate for loss
3. Loss may be caused by the indemnifier or any other person
4. There must be a promise to save from loss

#### Example

#### Rights of Indemnified (Section 125)

The promisee (indemnified), acting within the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover from the promisor (indemnifier):

1. **All damages** that he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity
2. **All costs** that he may be compelled to pay in bringing or defending such suits
3. **All sums** that he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of such suit

**Condition**: The compromise must not be contrary to the orders of the indemnifier and must have been prudent for the indemnified to make.

## Conclusion

The **Contract Act, 1872** provides the foundational legal framework for all contractual relationships in Bangladesh. Understanding the principles of contract formation, validity, performance, and discharge is essential for anyone engaged in business activities. Contracts are the lifeblood of commerce, and a solid grasp of contract law enables businesses to:

- Enter into enforceable agreements
- Protect their interests
- Understand their rights and obligations
- Resolve disputes effectively
- Plan transactions with legal certainty

The special contracts of indemnity, guarantee, bailment, and pledge are particularly important in various business contexts—from banking and finance to logistics and retail operations.

As you progress in your business studies, you will encounter these principles repeatedly in various contexts. The Contract Act, 1872, though more than 150 years old, remains remarkably relevant and continues to govern modern commercial transactions. Its principles have been interpreted and applied by courts in countless cases, creating a rich body of jurisprudence that guides business practice in Bangladesh today.

In the next chapter, we will explore the **Companies Act, 1994**, which governs the formation, operation, and regulation of companies in Bangladesh, building upon the contractual principles you have learned here.

- **Consideration**: Something of value exchanged
- **Capacity**: Legal ability to contract
- **Free Consent**: Consent not vitiated by coercion, fraud, etc.
- **Void Agreement**: Not enforceable from the beginning
