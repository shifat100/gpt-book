# Chapter 2: The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

## Introduction

The **Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881** is a fundamental law governing financial transactions and credit instruments in Bangladesh and other Commonwealth countries. This act provides the legal framework for the creation, transfer, and enforcement of negotiable instruments, which are essential tools in modern commerce and banking. Understanding negotiable instruments is crucial for business students as these instruments facilitate the smooth flow of credit and liquidity in the economy.

---

## 1. Definition: Negotiable Instruments

### Understanding Negotiable Instruments

A **negotiable instrument** is a written promise or order to pay a specified sum of money to a specified person or to the bearer of the instrument, payable either on demand or at a fixed or determinable future date.

According to **Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**, a negotiable instrument is defined as:

> *"An instrument made, drawn, accepted, endorsed, negotiated or transferred in accordance with the law relating to negotiable instruments, and which purports to be made, drawn, accepted, endorsed, negotiated or transferred by the person whose signature appears thereon."*

### Essential Characteristics of Negotiable Instruments

A document must possess the following characteristics to be classified as a negotiable instrument:

- **Written Document:** The instrument must be in writing; oral promises do not qualify.

- **Unconditional Order or Promise:** The instrument contains an unconditional order to pay or an unconditional promise to pay a specified sum of money.

- **Specified Sum of Money:** The amount must be definite and certain; vague or fluctuating amounts do not qualify.

- **Payee Specified or to Bearer:** The instrument must be payable either to a specified person, their order, or to the bearer.

- **Time of Payment Definite:** Payment must be either on demand or at a fixed or determinable future date.

- **Signed by the Maker or Drawer:** The person creating the instrument must sign it.

- **Freely Transferable:** The instrument must be capable of being transferred by delivery (bearer instruments) or by endorsement and delivery (order instruments).

- **Right to Sue:** The holder of the instrument must have the right to sue for enforcement in their own name.

### Legal Significance

The negotiability of an instrument confers special properties upon it:

- **Holder in Due Course Protection:** A **holder in due course** (HDC) obtains better rights than the original creditor, being free from many defenses available against prior parties.

- **Easy Transferability:** Negotiable instruments can be transferred with ease, making them suitable for commerce.

- **Presumptions:** The law creates presumptions in favor of the holder, such as consideration, proof of signatures, and regularity of the instrument.

## 2. Types: Characteristics of Promissory Note, Bill of Exchange, and Cheque

### Overview of Three Principal Negotiable Instruments

The **Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881** recognizes three main types of negotiable instruments. Each has distinct characteristics and legal implications.

---

### A. Promissory Note

#### Definition

According to **Section 4 of the Act**, a **promissory note** is:

> *"An instrument in writing (not being a bank-note or a currency note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument."*

#### Characteristics

- **Unconditional Promise:** Contains a promise (not merely an order) to pay money.

- **Two Parties:** Involves a **maker** (debtor/promisor) and a **payee** (creditor/promisee).

- **Fixed Amount:** The sum must be certain and specified.

- **Signed by Maker:** The maker's signature is essential and mandatory.

- **Payee Specified:** The payee must be clearly identified or made payable to bearer.

- **Maturity Date:** The date of payment must be fixed or determinable.

#### Example

*"I promise to pay Mr. Karim or order the sum of Taka 100,000 (One Lakh) only, on or before December 15, 2025, for value received. Dated this 12th day of December, 2025. Signed: Abdul Aziz."*

#### Parties Involved

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Maker** | The person who makes the promise to pay (debtor) |
| **Payee** | The person to whom the promise is made (creditor) |
| **Endorsee** | Any person to whom the note is transferred by endorsement |

#### Special Features

- **Self-Contained:** A promissory note is complete in itself; it does not require acceptance.

- **No Presentation for Acceptance:** Unlike bills of exchange, promissory notes are not presented for acceptance.

- **Liability of Maker:** The maker is primarily liable for payment.

---

### B. Bill of Exchange

#### Definition

According to **Section 5 of the Act**, a **bill of exchange** is:

> *"An instrument in writing, containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument."*

#### Characteristics

- **Unconditional Order:** Contains an order (not a promise) to pay money.

- **Three Parties:** Involves a **drawer** (maker), a **drawee**, and a **payee** (which may be the drawer or a third party).

| **Drawee** | The person directed to pay (debtor/buyer) |
| **Payee** | The person to whom payment is to be made (usually the drawer or third party) |
| **Endorsee** | Any person to whom the bill is transferred |

#### Special Features

- **Requires Acceptance:** A bill of exchange must be presented to the drawee for **acceptance** before it becomes binding.

- **Three-Party Instrument:** Unlike promissory notes, bills involve three parties.

- **International Trade:** Bills of exchange are commonly used in international commerce and trade finance.

- **Liability Distribution:** The drawer's and endorsers' liabilities are conditional upon dishonor by the drawee.

#### Types of Bills

- **Time Bill:** Payable at a fixed future date.
- **Documentary Bill:** Attached to shipping documents in international trade.

---

### C. Cheque

#### Definition

According to **Section 6 of the Act**, a **cheque** is:

> *"A bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand."*

In essence, a cheque is a special form of **bill of exchange** with unique characteristics.

#### Characteristics

- **Drawn on Bank:** Must be drawn on a bank (the drawee).

- **Payable on Demand:** Always payable on demand; cannot be post-dated with a future date making it payable later (though post-dated cheques are issued for convenience).

- **Written Order:** Contains an unconditional written order to pay.

- **Specific Amount:** The sum to be paid must be definite.

- **Banker as Drawee:** The bank against which the cheque is drawn acts as the drawee.

- **Cheque Holder:** The person to whom the cheque is issued is either the payee or endorsee.

#### Example

*"Dated: December 12, 2025*
*Pay to: Karim Khan or Order*
*Sum: Taka 25,000 (Twenty Five Thousand) only*
*Bank: Dhaka Bank Limited, Gulshan Branch*
*Account No: 123456789*
*Signed: Fatima Akhtar"*

#### Parties Involved

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Drawer** | The account holder who issues the cheque |
| **Drawee** | The bank on which the cheque is drawn |
| **Payee** | The person to whom the cheque is payable |
| **Endorsee** | Any person to whom the cheque is transferred |

#### Special Features

- **No Acceptance Required:** Unlike bills of exchange, cheques do not require acceptance by the bank (drawee).

- **Conditional on Funds:** Payment depends on the availability of funds in the drawer's account.

- **Instrument of Credit:** Cheques are instruments of credit and are the most commonly used negotiable instruments in modern commerce.

- **Statutory Protections:** Bangladesh law provides specific protections for cheques under the Negotiable Instruments Act and the **Penal Code, 1860** (regarding bounced cheques).

#### Types of Cheques

- **Open Cheque:** Can be encashed at the counter by the payee or any authorized person.
- **Crossed Cheque:** Has two parallel lines, restricting payment to a bank account only.

---

## 3. Process: Acceptance and Negotiation

### A. Acceptance of Negotiable Instruments

#### Concept of Acceptance

**Acceptance** is the process by which the drawee of a bill of exchange (or cheque) indicates their willingness to pay the instrument when it becomes due. Acceptance is a fundamental step in the life of a bill of exchange.

#### Definition and Legal Framework

According to **Section 24 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**:

> *"Acceptance of a bill of exchange is the signification by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. An acceptance is complete when the drawee has signed it, but not otherwise."*

#### Requirements for Valid Acceptance

- **Written Acceptance:** The acceptance must be in writing and signed by the drawee.

- **On the Bill Itself:** Acceptance is usually written on the bill itself, typically on the face of the instrument.

- **Drawee's Signature:** The drawee must sign the acceptance, which constitutes their promise to pay.

- **Clear Assent:** The acceptance must clearly indicate the drawee's agreement to pay.

- **Unconditional:** The acceptance must be unconditional; any conditional acceptance is treated as rejection.

#### Methods of Acceptance

- **General Acceptance:** The drawee accepts without qualification.
- **Qualified Acceptance:** The drawee accepts subject to certain conditions (e.g., "Accepted payable only from proceeds of sale").
- **Partial Acceptance:** The drawee accepts for a part of the amount only.
- **Acceptance in a Different Form:** For example, the drawee may accept for a different amount or on different terms.

#### Legal Effects of Acceptance

According to **Section 63** of the Act, upon acceptance:

- **Drawee Becomes Primarily Liable:** The drawee becomes the principal debtor and is primarily liable for payment.

- **Drawer's Liability Becomes Conditional:** The drawer's liability becomes conditional upon dishonor by the drawee.

- **Negotiability Enhanced:** The bill becomes more negotiable and valuable as a security.

- **Right to Sue:** The acceptor can be sued directly by the holder for payment.

#### Presentment for Acceptance

**Presentment for acceptance** is the formal presentation of a bill to the drawee for their acceptance.

**Section 61** of the Act stipulates:

- **Bills Payable After Sight:** Bills expressed to be payable at a certain time after sight **must** be presented for acceptance.

- **Bills Payable on Demand:** Bills payable on demand need not be presented for acceptance, though it is advisable.

- **Time for Presentment:** The bill must be presented within a reasonable time after its issue.

#### Consequences of Refusal to Accept

If the drawee refuses to accept the bill:

- **Dishonor by Non-Acceptance:** The bill is considered dishonored.

- **Notice of Dishonor:** The holder must immediately give notice of dishonor to the drawer and all endorsers.

- **Remedy Against Drawer and Endorsers:** The holder can recover from the drawer and endorsers.

---

### B. Negotiation of Negotiable Instruments

#### Concept of Negotiation

**Negotiation** is the process of transferring a negotiable instrument from one person to another in such a manner that the transferee becomes the holder and acquires the right to receive payment and to sue in their own name.

#### Definition

According to **Section 14 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**:

> *"Negotiation of an instrument is the transfer of possession, whether absolute or conditional, of an instrument, so as to constitute the transferee the holder thereof."*

#### Two Modes of Negotiation

**1. Negotiation of Bearer Instruments**

- **Method:** By delivery alone.
- **No Signature Required:** The current holder need not endorse or sign.
- **Simple Transfer:** Merely handing over the physical instrument transfers ownership.
- **Example:** A bearer cheque can be negotiated simply by handing it to another person.

**2. Negotiation of Order Instruments**

- **Method:** By endorsement and delivery.
- **Endorsement Mandatory:** The current holder must endorse the instrument by signing on the back.
- **Delivery Essential:** After endorsement, physical possession must be transferred.
- **Creates Liability:** The endorser becomes liable to the holder for payment.

#### Process of Endorsement

**Endorsement** is the act of signing the instrument (usually on the back) to transfer it to another person.

#### Types of Endorsements

**1. Blank Endorsement (Endorsement in Blank)**

- **Nature:** The endorser signs without specifying a payee.
- **Effect:** The instrument becomes payable to bearer.
- **Transferability:** Can be further transferred by delivery alone.
- **Example:** The endorser simply signs: *"Karim Khan"*

**2. Restrictive Endorsement**

- **Nature:** The endorsement restricts the negotiability or use of the instrument.
- **Common Forms:**
  - *"For deposit only"*
  - *"Pay to the order of X only"*
  - *"For collection"*
- **Effect:** The instrument cannot be further negotiated beyond the specified payee.

**3. Conditional Endorsement**

- **Nature:** The endorsement is made subject to a condition.
- **Example:** *"Pay to the order of X on receipt of goods"*
- **Effect:** The right to payment is conditional upon fulfillment of the condition.

**4. Full or Special Endorsement**

- **Nature:** The endorser specifies the name of the new payee.
- **Example:** *"Pay to the order of X. Signed: Y"*
- **Effect:** The instrument becomes payable to the specified person and must be further endorsed by them.

**5. Sans Recourse Endorsement**

- **Nature:** The endorser excludes themselves from liability by writing "without recourse."
- **Example:** *"Without recourse, pay to X. Signed: Y"*
- **Effect:** The endorser is not liable if the instrument is later dishonored.

#### Holder and Holder in Due Course

**Holder**

According to **Section 2(f)**, a **holder** is:

> *"The payee or endorsee of a bill, note, or cheque, or the bearer thereof, as the case may be."*

**Holder in Due Course (HDC)**

According to **Section 29**, a **holder in due course** is a holder who has taken the instrument:

- **In good faith:** Without knowledge of any defect in the title.
- **For value:** Has given valuable consideration.
- **Before maturity:** Before the instrument became due.
- **Without notice of dishonor:** Without knowledge that the instrument has been dishonored.

#### Advantages of Being a Holder in Due Course

- **Superior Rights:** Can enforce the instrument against all parties, even if there are defects in the title of prior parties.
- **Defense Limitations:** Cannot be defeated by defenses that would be available against the original creditor.
- **Presumptions:** Enjoys presumptions regarding regularity, consideration, and signatures.
- **Better Security:** Provides a more secure title and recourse for payment.

---

## 5. Dishonor: Dishonor of Negotiable Instruments (Causes and Consequences)

### A. Concept of Dishonor

**Dishonor** occurs when a negotiable instrument is not paid or accepted when it is properly presented and the party liable to pay refuses to do so.

#### Definition

According to **Section 92 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**:

> *"An instrument is dishonored by non-acceptance if the drawee makes default in or refuses to accept the bill within the time allowed for acceptance."*

Similarly, according to **Section 93**:

> *"An instrument is dishonored by non-payment when the maker, acceptor, or drawee of it, as the case may be, makes default in payment of the instrument or part thereof, or when the instrument has been materially altered."*

---

### B. Causes of Dishonor

#### 1. Dishonor by Non-Acceptance

**When It Occurs:**

Dishonor by non-acceptance occurs when a bill of exchange is presented for acceptance and the drawee refuses or fails to accept it.

**Grounds for Non-Acceptance:**

- **No Funds or Account:** The drawee has no account or funds with the drawer.

- **Dispute with Drawer:** The drawee disputes the underlying transaction with the drawer.

- **Technical Defects:** The bill has technical defects or irregularities.

- **Refusal Without Cause:** The drawee simply refuses to accept without providing any reason.

- **Conditional Acceptance:** The drawee offers conditional acceptance, which is treated as a refusal.

#### 2. Dishonor by Non-Payment

**When It Occurs:**

Dishonor by non-payment occurs when an instrument is properly presented for payment and payment is refused.

**Grounds for Non-Payment:**

- **Insufficient Funds:** The account has insufficient funds to cover the amount.

- **Account Closed:** The drawer's or maker's account with the bank is closed.

- **Countermand of Payment:** The drawer has issued an order (stop payment) to the bank to refuse payment.

- **Cheque Post-Dated:** The cheque is post-dated and presented before the stated date.

- **Cheque Stale:** The cheque is more than six months old (considered "stale").

- **Technical Defects:** The cheque has defects such as:
  - Erasures or alterations
  - Signature mismatch
  - Amount discrepancy (figures vs. words)
  - Missing date

- **Forged Signature:** The drawer's signature is forged or the signature is illegible.

- **Death or Insanity:** The drawer is deceased or has been declared of unsound mind.

- **Bankruptcy:** The drawer/maker is declared bankrupt.

#### 3. Dishonor by Material Alteration

**Material Alterations Include:**

- **Change in Amount:** The amount payable is altered.
- **Change in Date:** The date of the instrument or maturity date is changed.
- **Change in Payee:** The name of the payee is altered.
- **Change in Terms:** Other essential terms are modified.

**Effect of Alteration:**

- **Instrument Becomes Void:** A materially altered instrument cannot be enforced in its altered form.
- **Exception for Innocent Parties:** An innocent alterer may be able to recover for the original amount if they can prove their innocence.

---

### C. Notice of Dishonor

#### Concept and Importance

**Notice of dishonor** is a formal communication to the drawer and endorsers that the instrument has been dishonored, enabling them to take corrective action and preserving their recourse rights.

#### Legal Framework

According to **Section 91** of the Act:

> *"Notice of dishonor must be given to the parties against whom recourse is sought; without such notice, the drawer and endorsers are discharged from liability."*

#### Essential Requirements of Notice

A valid notice of dishonor must:

- **Be Given in Reasonable Time:** 
  - Within a reasonable time after dishonor
  - Generally, within 24 hours (though "reasonable time" depends on circumstances)
  - Delays that prejudice the party relieve them of liability

- **Identify the Instrument:** 
  - Must clearly identify the dishonored instrument
  - Should reference the amount, date, and parties

- **State the Fact of Dishonor:** 
  - Must clearly state that the instrument has been dishonored
  - Should mention whether dishonor is by non-acceptance or non-payment

- **Be Signed by the Holder or Agent:** 
  - Must be signed by the holder or authorized agent
  - Can be given in writing or orally (though writing is preferable)

- **Be Properly Delivered:**
  - Must reach the party for whom it is intended
  - Can be given personally, by post, or through authorized agents

#### Who Must Give Notice?

- **Holder's Duty:** The holder of the instrument has a duty to give notice to the drawer and endorsers.

- **Endorser's Duty:** An endorser must give notice to prior endorsers when dishonor occurs.

- **Bank's Duty:** In case of cheques, the bank acts on behalf of the holder in giving notice.

#### To Whom Notice Must Be Given?

- **Drawer:** Must be notified of non-acceptance or non-payment.
- **Endorsers:** All endorsers (in the order of their endorsement) must be notified.
- **Acceptor (Optional):** Generally, notice need not be given to the acceptor unless required by the instrument.

#### Consequences of Failure to Give Notice

According to **Section 93**, if notice of dishonor is not given within reasonable time:

- **Drawer is Discharged:** The drawer is discharged from all liabilities on the instrument.

- **Endorsers are Discharged:** All endorsers are discharged from their conditional liabilities.

- **Except to HDC:** However, failure to give notice does not discharge the party against a holder in due course, provided the HDC is not prejudiced.

---

### D. Consequences of Dishonor

#### 1. Consequences for the Holder

**Right to Sue:**

- The holder can immediately sue the drawer, acceptor, and endorsers for the amount of the instrument.

- The holder can also sue for:
  - Interest from the date of dishonor
  - Reasonable expenses incurred for protesting the instrument

**Right to Protest:**

- For bills of exchange, the holder can obtain a formal protest (a notarial document) certifying the dishonor.

- A protest is strong evidence of dishonor and is valuable in legal proceedings.

**Loss of Interest:**

- The holder loses the right to claim interest after dishonor (unless specifically provided in the instrument).

#### 2. Consequences for the Drawer

**Immediate Liability:**

- Upon dishonor and proper notice, the drawer becomes liable to the holder for the full amount of the instrument.

- The drawer can be sued in civil court for recovery.

**Personal and Business Consequences:**

- **Reputation Damage:** Dishonor of an instrument damages the drawer's creditworthiness and business reputation.

- **Credit Impact:** Banks and creditors may reduce credit limits or recall existing credit facilities.

- **Loss of Credit:** The drawer may find it difficult to obtain credit in the future.

#### 3. Consequences for the Maker

**Absolute Liability:**

- The maker of a dishonored promissory note remains absolutely liable to the holder.

- The maker can be sued for:
  - Principal amount
  - Interest
  - Costs of suit

**Credit Consequences:**

- Similar to drawers, makers face reputational and credit consequences.

#### 4. Consequences for the Acceptor

- The acceptor can be sued immediately by any subsequent holder.

#### 5. Consequences for Endorsers

**Conditional Liability:**

- Upon dishonor and proper notice, endorsers become liable to the holder.

- Each endorser is liable to subsequent endorsees but is released from liability to prior endorsors.

**Right to Defend:**

- Endorsers can raise any defenses available to them, including:
  - Lack of consideration
  - Breach of underlying contract

#### 6. Criminal Consequences in Bangladesh

Under **Bangladesh Law**, particularly the **Penal Code, 1860** and specific provisions in the **Negotiable Instruments Act**, dishonor of cheques can attract **criminal liability**.

**Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881** (as adopted in Bangladesh):

> *"Whoever makes, draws, issues, or puts into circulation any cheque, knowing that at the time of its presentment there are no sufficient funds in the specified account, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both."*

**Criminal Liability for Bounced Cheques:**

- **Mens Rea (Criminal Intent):** The person must have knowledge that funds were insufficient.

- **Punishment:**
  - Imprisonment up to 2 years
  - Fine up to twice the cheque amount
  - Both imprisonment and fine

- **Cognizable Offense:** It is a cognizable offense, allowing police to arrest without warrant.

- **Burden of Proof:** Initially, the drawer is presumed to have knowledge of insufficient funds.

- **Defense Available:** The drawer can defend by proving that the cheque was issued in good faith believing sufficient funds existed.

### E. Discharge of Negotiable Instruments

#### Concept of Discharge

**Discharge** refers to the release of a party or all parties from liability on a negotiable instrument.

#### Ways of Discharge

**1. Discharge by Payment**

- Payment of the full amount discharges all parties.
- Payment must be made by or on behalf of the party liable.
- Payment must be made at or after maturity.
- Full payment discharges the instrument and all parties.

**2. Discharge by Acceptance for Honor**

- A third party can accept a dishonored bill to preserve the credit of the drawer and endorsers.
- This is done when the original acceptor refuses to accept.

**3. Discharge by Cancellation**

- Intentional cancellation of the instrument discharges all parties.
- Can be done by destruction or marking the instrument as cancelled.
- Mere crossing out must be unequivocal to be effective.

**4. Discharge by Release**

- The holder can release the maker, drawer, or acceptor by:
  - Written release
  - Oral release (though writing is preferable)
  - Delivering the instrument to the party with intent to release

**5. Discharge by Non-Presentment**

- If an instrument is not presented within a reasonable time:
  - The drawer and endorsers may be discharged
  - The primary party (maker/acceptor) is not discharged

**6. Discharge by Delay**

- Unreasonable delay in presentment after maturity can discharge endorsers.
- The drawer and maker are not discharged unless materially prejudiced.

**7. Discharge by Material Alteration**

- Material alteration discharges the instrument.
- Innocent parties may be able to recover for the original amount.

**8. Discharge by Insolvency/Bankruptcy**

- The insolvency or bankruptcy of the drawer may discharge endorsers in certain circumstances.
- The primary liability of the maker/acceptor remains.

- **Recovery Claim:**
  - Principal amount
  - Interest at prescribed rates
  - Costs and expenses of suit
  - Damages if applicable

**Specific Performance:**

- In rare cases, the court may order specific performance if the instrument involves property or specific goods.

**Injunction:**

Under **Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act** (applicable in Bangladesh):

- **Criminal Case Filing:** A complaint can be filed against the drawer.

- **Police Investigation:** Police can investigate the matter.

- **Prosecution:** The drawer can be prosecuted and punished as mentioned earlier.

- **Compounding:** The parties can compound (settle) the offense if the drawer repays the amount with interest.

#### 3. Protest and Formal Notice

**Protest:**

- A notarial protest (in case of bills of exchange) is strong evidence of dishonor.

- The protest document details:
  - The fact of dishonor
  - Date and place of presentation
  - Reason for refusal (if given)
  - Expenses incurred

**Use in Legal Proceedings:**

- Protest is admissible as evidence in court.
- It shifts the burden to the accused to prove otherwise.

- Recourse includes:
  - Principal amount
