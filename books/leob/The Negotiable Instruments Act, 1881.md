# Chapter 2: The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

## Introduction

In modern commerce, the exchange of goods and services rarely involves immediate cash payment. Business transactions often require credit mechanisms that are secure, transferable, and legally enforceable. **Negotiable instruments** serve this critical function by facilitating credit transactions and enabling the easy transfer of money without the physical movement of currency.

The **Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881** is a crucial piece of legislation that governs the use of negotiable instruments in Bangladesh. Originally enacted during the British colonial period, this Act has been amended several times to adapt to changing commercial practices. Understanding negotiable instruments is essential for business students, as these instruments—particularly cheques, promissory notes, and bills of exchange—form the backbone of commercial transactions, banking operations, and credit systems.

This chapter explores the fundamental principles of negotiable instruments, their types, the process of negotiation, the rights and liabilities of various parties, and the legal consequences of dishonor.

## 1. Definition of Negotiable Instruments

### 1.1 What is a Negotiable Instrument?

The term "negotiable instrument" is not explicitly defined in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. However, **Section 13** provides a partial definition:

> "A negotiable instrument means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer."

A **negotiable instrument** can be understood as a written document that:
- Contains an unconditional promise or order to pay a certain sum of money
- Is transferable by delivery (if payable to bearer) or by endorsement and delivery (if payable to order)
- Confers upon the transferee (holder) the right to sue in their own name
- Is free from defects in the title of prior parties when transferred to a bona fide holder for value

### 1.2 Essential Characteristics of Negotiable Instruments

For an instrument to be negotiable, it must possess the following characteristics:

#### 1. **Transferability**
- The instrument can be freely transferred from one person to another
- Transfer is by delivery alone (for bearer instruments) or by endorsement and delivery (for order instruments)
- The transferee becomes the holder and can sue in their own name

#### 2. **Title Free from Defects**
- When a negotiable instrument is transferred to a **holder in due course**, they receive a good and complete title
- The holder in due course is not affected by defects in the title of previous holders
- This is the fundamental principle: "A transferee can have a better title than the transferor"

#### 3. **Right to Sue in Own Name**
- The holder of a negotiable instrument can sue on the instrument in their own name
- No notice to any prior party is necessary

#### 4. **Written and Signed Document**
- Must be in writing
- Must be signed by the maker (in case of promissory note) or drawer (in case of bill of exchange or cheque)

#### 5. **Unconditional Promise or Order**
- Contains an unconditional promise or order to pay
- No conditions can be attached to the payment

#### 6. **Payment of Money Only**
- The instrument must be for the payment of money only
- Cannot be for delivery of goods or performance of services

#### 7. **Certain Sum**
- The amount payable must be certain and definite
- No ambiguity regarding the amount

#### 8. **Proper Parties**
- There must be a maker or drawer
- There must be a payee or drawee
- The parties must be certain

#### 9. **Payable on Demand or at Fixed Time**
- Must be payable either on demand or at a determinable future date

### 1.3 Types of Negotiability

**1. Negotiable by Statute**
- Instruments that are declared negotiable by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
- Include: Promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques

**2. Negotiable by Custom or Usage**
- Instruments recognized as negotiable by mercantile custom
- Include: Treasury bills, dividend warrants, share warrants, bearer debentures
- Not covered by the Negotiable Instruments Act but recognized by courts

## 2. Types of Negotiable Instruments

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 recognizes three types of negotiable instruments:
1. **Promissory Note**
2. **Bill of Exchange**

## 3. Negotiation Process

### 3.1 Meaning of Negotiation (Section 14)

"When a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is transferred to any person, so as to constitute that person the holder thereof, the instrument is said to be negotiated."

**Negotiation** means the transfer of a negotiable instrument from one person to another in such a manner as to constitute the transferee the holder of the instrument.

### 3.2 Methods of Negotiation (Section 47)

The method of negotiation depends on whether the instrument is payable to **bearer** or to **order**:

#### 1. Negotiation of Bearer Instruments (Section 47)

- A promissory note, bill of exchange, or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by **delivery alone**
- No endorsement is required
- Mere physical transfer of the instrument is sufficient

**Example**: If a cheque is payable "to bearer," it can be transferred by simply handing it over to another person.

#### 2. Negotiation of Order Instruments (Section 48)

- A promissory note, bill of exchange, or cheque payable to order is negotiable by **endorsement and delivery**
- Both endorsement (signature of the holder) and physical delivery are necessary

**Example**: If a cheque is payable "to Mr. Ahmed or order," Mr. Ahmed must endorse (sign) the cheque on the back and deliver it to transfer it.

### 3.3 Endorsement

#### Definition (Section 15)

"When the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument signs the same, otherwise than as such maker, for the purpose of negotiation, on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto, or so signs for the same purpose a stamped paper intended to be completed as a negotiable instrument, he is said to endorse the same, and is called the endorser."

The person to whom the instrument is endorsed is called the **endorsee**.

#### Essentials of a Valid Endorsement

**1. Made by Maker or Holder**
- Only the maker or holder can endorse
- A stranger cannot endorse

**2. Signature of Endorser**
- Must be signed by the endorser
- Thumb impression with witnesses is acceptable

**3. On the Instrument Itself**
- Usually on the back of the instrument
- Can be on the face or on a slip attached (called **allonge**)

**4. For the Purpose of Negotiation**
- Must be intended to transfer the instrument

**5. Delivery is Essential**
- Endorsement alone is not sufficient
- Must be followed by delivery

**6. Must be Completed**
- An incomplete endorsement does not transfer title

#### Types of Endorsement

**1. Blank or General Endorsement (Section 16)**
- Endorser simply signs their name without specifying the endorsee
- The instrument becomes payable to bearer
- Can be further negotiated by mere delivery

**Example**: 
```
Pay to bearer
(Signed) Ahmed
```

**2. Special or Full Endorsement (Section 16)**
- Endorser specifies the person to whom or to whose order the payment is to be made
- The instrument remains payable to order
- Requires endorsement for further negotiation

**Example**:
```
Pay to Karim or order
(Signed) Ahmed
```

**3. Restrictive Endorsement (Section 50)**
- Restricts further negotiation of the instrument
- Uses words like "Pay to Karim only" or "Pay to Karim for my account"
- The endorsee cannot further negotiate the instrument

**Example**:
```
Pay to Karim only
(Signed) Ahmed
```

**4. Partial Endorsement (Section 56)**
- Endorsement of part of the amount
- Not valid under the Act
- The instrument must be endorsed for the full amount

**5. Conditional Endorsement (Section 52)**
- Contains a condition for payment
- Example: "Pay to Karim if he completes the work"
- The condition is binding on the endorser but not on other parties
- The drawee/acceptor must pay regardless of the condition

**6. Sans Recours Endorsement (Without Recourse)**
- Endorser excludes their own liability
- Uses words like "Without recourse" or "At endorsee's risk"
- The endorser is not liable if the instrument is dishonored

**Example**:
```
Pay to Karim without recourse to me
(Signed) Ahmed
```

**7. Facultative Endorsement**
- Endorser waives some right available under the Act
- Example: Waiving the right to notice of dishonor

### 3.4 Holder and Holder in Due Course

#### Holder (Section 8)

"The holder of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque means any person entitled in his own name to the possession thereof and to receive or recover the amount due thereon from the parties thereto."

A holder may be:
- The original payee
- An endorsee
- A bearer (if payable to bearer)

#### Holder in Due Course (Section 9)

"Holder in due course means any person who for consideration became the possessor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque if payable to bearer, or the payee or endorsee thereof, if payable to order, before the amount mentioned in it became payable, and without having sufficient cause to believe that any defect existed in the title of the person from whom he derived his title."

**Essential Conditions:**

**1. Must be a Holder**
- Must have possession of the instrument
- Must be entitled in their own name

**2. For Consideration**
- Must have given value (consideration) for the instrument
- Consideration need not be adequate but must exist

**3. Before Maturity**
- Must have obtained the instrument before its due date
- After maturity, one cannot be a holder in due course

**4. In Good Faith**
- Must have taken the instrument in good faith
- Must not have sufficient cause to believe there was any defect in the title

**5. Complete and Regular on Face**
- The instrument must appear complete and regular
- No apparent defects or irregularities

#### Rights and Privileges of Holder in Due Course (Section 53)

A holder in due course holds the instrument **free from all defects** of title of prior parties. They have better title than the transferor. This means:

**1. Good Title**
- Gets a valid title even if the transferor had defective title
- Exception to the general rule "nemo dat quod non habet" (no one can give what they don't have)

**2. Not Affected by Prior Defects**
- Not affected by fraud, coercion, or illegality between prior parties

**3. Can Sue All Prior Parties**
- Can sue all prior parties in their own name
- All prior parties are liable

**4. Not Affected by Conditional Delivery**
- If the instrument was delivered conditionally by a prior party, the holder in due course is not affected

**Example**: A obtains a cheque from B through fraud. A endorses it to C (a holder in due course). C can enforce payment against B even though the cheque was obtained by fraud.

### 3.5 Acceptance

#### Meaning of Acceptance (Section 7)

**Acceptance** means the signification by the drawee of their assent to the order of the drawer.

Acceptance is relevant only for **bills of exchange** (not for promissory notes or cheques).

#### Why Acceptance is Necessary

- A bill of exchange is an order by the drawer to the drawee to pay
- Until the drawee accepts, they are not liable on the instrument
- Acceptance converts the drawee into an **acceptor** and makes them primarily liable

#### Who Can Accept?

- The drawee named in the bill
- In case of need, an **acceptor for honor** (when the drawee refuses)

#### Time of Presentment for Acceptance (Section 61-62)

**When Presentment for Acceptance is Necessary:**

1. When the bill is payable **after sight** (acceptance determines the maturity date)
2. When the bill expressly stipulates that it should be presented for acceptance
3. When the bill is drawn payable at a place other than the residence or place of business of the drawee

**When Presentment for Acceptance is Not Necessary:**

1. When the bill is payable **on demand** or **at sight**
2. When the drawee cannot be found after reasonable search
3. When the drawee is dead or insolvent
4. Where the drawer and drawee are the same person

#### Types of Acceptance

**1. General Acceptance (Section 86)**
- Unconditional acceptance of the bill as drawn
- Acceptor agrees to pay according to the tenor of the bill

**2. Qualified Acceptance (Section 86)**
- Acceptance with some condition or qualification
- Changes the effect of the bill

**Types of Qualified Acceptance:**

**(a) Conditional Acceptance**
- Acceptance subject to a condition
- Example: "Accepted, payable when I receive payment from X"

**(b) Partial Acceptance**
- Acceptance for part of the amount only
- Example: Accepting to pay Tk. 50,000 out of Tk. 100,000

**(c) Local Acceptance**
- Acceptance to pay at a particular place only
- Example: "Accepted, payable at Dhaka only"

**(d) Qualified as to Time**
- Acceptance that changes the time of payment
- Example: Accepting a 3-month bill as a 6-month bill

**(e) Acceptance by One or More Drawees but Not All**
- When there are multiple drawees, acceptance by fewer than all

**Effect of Qualified Acceptance:**

- The holder may refuse qualified acceptance and treat the bill as dishonored
- If the holder accepts the qualified acceptance, all prior parties who did not consent are discharged

#### Form of Acceptance (Section 88)

- Acceptance must be written on the bill
- Must be signed by the drawee
- Simple signature of the drawee is sufficient
- Usually written across the face: "Accepted" with signature and date

**Example**:
```
Accepted
Date: 15th January, 2025
(Signed) Rahim (Drawee/Acceptor)
```

#### 2. Liability of Drawer of Bill or Cheque (Section 30, 31)

- The drawer is **conditionally liable** (secondarily liable)
- Drawer's liability arises only when:
  - The bill/cheque is duly presented for payment
  - It is dishonored
  - Due notice of dishonor is given
- If these conditions are met, the drawer must compensate the holder

**Example**: If A draws a cheque on Bank X in favor of B, and the cheque is dishonored, A is liable to compensate B (provided due notice was given).

#### 3. Liability of Drawee/Acceptor of Bill (Section 32)

- The drawee has **no liability** until they accept the bill
- Once accepted, the acceptor becomes **primarily and unconditionally liable**

- The bank's liability arises from the **contract of banker-customer**
- The bank must honor cheques if:
  - Sufficient funds are available
  - The cheque is in order
  - Presented within validity period
- If the bank wrongfully dishonors, it is liable to the customer (drawer), not the payee

#### 5. Liability of Endorser (Section 35)

**Example**: A promissory note is made by X and endorsed by A, B, and C in that order. If C (the last endorser) pays the holder, C can recover from B, B from A, and A from X (the maker).

#### 6. Liability of Prior Parties (Section 36)

- Every prior party to a negotiable instrument is liable to the holder in due course until the instrument is duly satisfied

#### 7. Liability of Material Alteration (Section 87)

- Any material alteration in a negotiable instrument renders it void as against anyone who was a party at the time of alteration
- Exception: The alteration does not affect the rights of a holder in due course who was not party to the alteration
- Material alterations include: date, amount, place of payment, parties, etc.

**Example**: If a cheque for Tk. 10,000 is altered to Tk. 100,000, the instrument is void. However, if it reaches a holder in due course who was unaware of the alteration, they can enforce the instrument for the original amount.

**Offense:**
Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by them with a banker for payment of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or liability, is returned by the bank unpaid for insufficient funds or exceeding arrangement, or the drawer orders the bank to stop payment, the drawer is deemed to have committed an offense.

- **Fine**: Up to twice the amount of the cheque, or
- **Both** imprisonment and fine

**Example Timeline:**

- 5th February 2025: 15-day notice period expires
- 5th March 2025: Last date to file criminal complaint (within 1 month)

**Defenses Available to Drawer:**

## Conclusion

The **Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881** is a cornerstone of commercial law in Bangladesh, facilitating trade, credit, and the smooth flow of money in the economy. Understanding negotiable instruments is crucial for:

- **Business Transactions**: Most commercial dealings involve cheques, promissory notes, or bills of exchange
- **Banking Operations**: Banks heavily rely on negotiable instruments for their day-to-day operations
- **Credit Management**: Businesses extend and receive credit through these instruments
- **Legal Protection**: Knowledge of rights, liabilities, and remedies protects parties in commercial disputes

The three primary negotiable instruments—**promissory notes**, **bills of exchange**, and **cheques**—each serve distinct purposes in commerce. While promissory notes represent a direct promise to pay, bills of exchange facilitate credit transactions across parties, and cheques provide a convenient mechanism for payment through banks.

The concept of **negotiability** allows these instruments to pass freely in trade, creating liquidity and trust in commercial transactions. The protection afforded to a **holder in due course** encourages acceptance of these instruments and promotes commercial certainty.

The provisions regarding **dishonor**, particularly the criminal liability under **Section 138** for dishonor of cheques, have significantly strengthened the credibility of cheques in Bangladesh. This provision has become one of the most frequently invoked in commercial litigation, emphasizing the serious consequences of issuing cheques without adequate funds.

As Bangladesh's economy continues to grow and digital payment systems emerge, the principles established in the Negotiable Instruments Act remain relevant, with adaptations being made to accommodate electronic instruments and modern banking practices.

In the next chapter, we will explore the **Companies Act, 1994**, which governs the formation, management, and regulation of companies—the primary vehicles for conducting large-scale business operations in Bangladesh.

**Case Studies for Discussion:**

**Case Study 1: Holder in Due Course**

A draws a cheque in favor of B for Tk. 50,000. B induces A to issue the cheque through fraud. B endorses the cheque to C, who takes it in good faith and for value, without knowledge of the fraud. Can A refuse payment to C on the ground that the cheque was obtained by fraud?

**Case Study 2: Dishonor and Section 138**

X issues a post-dated cheque to Y for Tk. 200,000 on 1st January 2025, dated 1st March 2025. Y presents the cheque on 15th January 2025, and the bank dishonors it stating "post-dated cheque." Y files a criminal complaint under Section 138. Will the complaint succeed?

**Case Study 3: Material Alteration**

A issues a cheque for Tk. 10,000 to B. B alters the amount to Tk. 100,000 and endorses it to C, a holder in due course. What are the rights of C?

---

**Practical Exercise:**

**Draft the following documents:**

1. A promissory note where Rahim promises to pay Karim Tk. 500,000 three months after date
2. A bill of exchange where Jamal (drawer) orders Rahim (drawee) to pay Karim (payee) Tk. 300,000 on demand
3. A cheque for Tk. 150,000 with account payee crossing
4. A legal notice for dishonor of cheque under Section 138
