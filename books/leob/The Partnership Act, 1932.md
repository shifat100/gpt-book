## 5. Registration of Firms

### **Registration Procedure**

* Registration under the Partnership Act is **optional** but beneficial.
* Steps:

  1. Submit application to the Registrar.
  2. Provide details: firm name, partners’ names, business address, duration.
  3. Pay prescribed fees.
  4. Registrar records the entry and issues a **Certificate of Registration**.

### **Consequences of Non-Registration**

If a firm is not registered:

* It **cannot sue** third parties to enforce contractual rights.
* Partners **cannot sue each other** to enforce rights under the Act.
* A partner cannot claim rights to the firm’s property through court.
* However, unregistered firms **can be sued**, and partners retain rights for:

  * Dissolution
  * Realizing firm’s assets
  * Accounting after dissolution

## Summary

* The Partnership Act, 1932 governs the rights, duties, and liabilities of partners.
* Partnership depends heavily on **agreement** and **mutual agency**.
* Registration is not compulsory but highly recommended because non-registration restricts legal rights.
* Dissolution rules ensure fair settlement of liabilities and distribution of assets.
