# Chapter 3: The Sale of Goods Act, 1930

## Introduction

The buying and selling of goods is the most fundamental and common commercial transaction in any economy. From a small purchase at a neighborhood shop to large-scale international trade, the principles governing the sale of goods form the foundation of commercial law. The **Sale of Goods Act, 1930** is a special statute that governs contracts for the sale of goods in Bangladesh.

While the **Contract Act, 1872** provides general principles applicable to all contracts, the Sale of Goods Act provides specific rules tailored to contracts involving the transfer of goods. This Act was enacted to consolidate and clarify the law relating to the sale of goods, replacing the provisions previously contained in Chapter VII of the Contract Act.

Understanding the Sale of Goods Act is crucial for business students because:
- It governs the most frequent type of commercial transaction
- It protects both buyers and sellers by establishing clear rights and obligations
- It provides remedies for breach of contract
- It establishes rules for transfer of ownership and risk
- It applies to both domestic and international trade (unless modified by other agreements)

This chapter explores the essential elements of contracts for the sale of goods, the distinction between sale and agreement to sell, rules for transfer of property, delivery obligations, and the implied conditions and warranties that protect parties in sale transactions.

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1 Contract of Sale (Section 4)

According to **Section 4(1)**: "A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price."

**Essential Elements:**
1. **Bilateral Contract**: Involves at least two parties (buyer and seller)
2. **Transfer of Property**: Transfer or agreement to transfer ownership
3. **Goods**: The subject matter must be goods
4. **Price**: Consideration must be in money (called "price")

### 1.2 Goods (Section 2(7))

"Goods means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale."

#### Categories of Goods

**1. Based on Existence:**

**a. Existing Goods (Section 6(1))**
- Goods that are owned and possessed by the seller at the time of contract
- Example: Goods displayed in a shop

**Types of Existing Goods:**

**(i) Specific Goods (Section 2(14))**
- Goods identified and agreed upon at the time of contract
- Example: A particular car with registration number DM-1234

**(ii) Ascertained Goods**
- Goods identified after the contract is made
- Example: 100 bags of rice to be selected from a larger stock

**(iii) Unascertained Goods (Section 2(15))**
- Goods not specifically identified at the time of contract
- Defined only by description
- Example: "100 bags of Basmati rice" without identifying specific bags

**b. Future Goods (Section 6(2))**
- Goods to be manufactured, produced, or acquired by the seller after making the contract
- Example: Crops to be grown next season, goods to be manufactured

**c. Contingent Goods**
- Goods the acquisition of which depends on a contingency
- May or may not come into existence
- Example: Goods to be imported if import license is obtained

**2. Based on Physical State:**

**a. Tangible Goods**
- Goods that can be physically touched and seen
- Example: Furniture, electronics, vehicles

**b. Intangible Goods**
- Rights that can be transferred
- Includes: patents, copyrights, trademarks (though these have special regulations)

**What is NOT "Goods":**
- **Immovable Property**: Land, buildings (governed by Transfer of Property Act)
- **Money**: Currency used as consideration
- **Actionable Claims**: Debts, rights to sue (governed by Transfer of Property Act)
- **Services**: Pure services without transfer of goods

### 1.3 Seller (Section 2(13))

"A seller is a person who sells or agrees to sell goods."

The seller is the party who:
- Transfers or agrees to transfer property in goods
- Must have the right to sell the goods

### 1.5 Price (Section 2(10))

"Price means the money consideration for a sale of goods."

**Characteristics:**
- Must be in money (not barter)
- Must be certain or capable of being made certain
- May be fixed by the contract, by agreement, or by course of dealing

**Determination of Price (Section 9):**

**1. Fixed by Contract**
- Parties agree on a specific price at the time of contract
- Example: "Tk. 500,000 for the car"

**2. To be Fixed in Manner Agreed**
- Price to be determined by a method agreed upon
- Example: "Price will be market rate on delivery date"

**3. Determined by Course of Dealing**
- Based on previous transactions between parties
- Example: Regular customers getting standard prices

**4. Reasonable Price**
- If price is not determined by the above methods, buyer must pay a reasonable price
- What is "reasonable" depends on circumstances

**5. Third Party Valuation**
- Parties may agree that a third party will fix the price
- If the third party fails to fix price:
  - Contract may be avoided
  - If goods are delivered and appropriated, buyer must pay reasonable price

### 1.6 Delivery (Section 2(2))

"Delivery means voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another."

Delivery can be:
- **Actual**: Physical handing over of goods

## 2. The Contract of Sale

### 2.1 Sale vs. Agreement to Sell

The Sale of Goods Act distinguishes between a **sale** and an **agreement to sell**. This distinction is crucial as it determines when ownership transfers and who bears the risk.

#### Sale (Section 4(3))

"Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale."

**Characteristics:**
- Ownership (property) transfers immediately
- It is an executed contract
- Creates a relationship of debtor and creditor between buyer and seller
- If goods are destroyed, loss falls on the buyer

#### Agreement to Sell (Section 4(3))

"Where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell."

**Characteristics:**
- Ownership remains with seller
- It is an executory contract
- Transfer of ownership is postponed to future date or subject to conditions
- If goods are destroyed, loss falls on the seller

**An agreement to sell becomes a sale when:**
- The specified time arrives, or
- The conditions subject to which property was to be transferred are fulfilled

### 2.2 Distinction Between Sale and Agreement to Sell

| **Aspect** | **Sale** | **Agreement to Sell** |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Transfer of Property** | Immediate transfer | Future transfer |
| **Nature** | Executed contract | Executory contract |
| **Relationship** | Buyer and seller are debtor-creditor | Buyer and seller remain contracting parties |
| **Risk** | Risk passes to buyer immediately | Risk remains with seller |
| **Insolvency** | If seller becomes insolvent, buyer can claim goods | If seller becomes insolvent, buyer has no claim on goods (only damages) |
| **Breach of Contract** | Buyer can sue for price | Buyer can only sue for damages |
| **Right to Sell Again** | Seller cannot sell again; second sale is void | Seller can sell to another; becomes breach of contract |
| **Suit by Third Party** | If third party damages goods, buyer can sue | Only seller can sue |
| **Type of Contract** | Sale (absolute) | Contract to sell (conditional) |

**Example:**

**Sale**: A goes to a shop and buys a book for Tk. 500. Payment is made and the book is delivered immediately. Ownership transfers at once. This is a **sale**.

**Agreement to Sell**: A orders a custom-made suit from a tailor for Tk. 5,000, to be delivered after 15 days. Until delivery, ownership remains with the tailor. This is an **agreement to sell**, which becomes a **sale** upon delivery.

### 2.3 Essential Elements of a Contract of Sale

For a valid contract of sale, the following elements must be present:

#### 1. Two Parties (Buyer and Seller)
- Must be at least two distinct parties
- Same person cannot be both buyer and seller
- However, a partner can buy from their own partnership firm

#### 2. Goods
- Subject matter must be goods (movable property)
- Must be lawful goods

#### 3. Price (Money Consideration)
- Consideration must be in money
- If goods are exchanged for goods, it is **barter** (not sale)
- If partly goods and partly money, it is sale

#### 4. Transfer of Property
- There must be transfer or agreement to transfer ownership
- Mere possession transfer without ownership is not sale (it's bailment)

#### 5. Essential Elements of a Valid Contract
- All elements under Contract Act, 1872 must be satisfied:
  - Free consent
  - Capacity to contract
  - Lawful consideration and object
  - Not expressly declared void

#### 6. Absolute or Conditional Transfer
- Transfer may be absolute (immediate) or conditional (future)

### 2.4 Sale vs. Other Transactions

#### 1. Sale vs. Barter/Exchange

**Sale:**
- Consideration is money (price)
- Governed by Sale of Goods Act

**Barter/Exchange:**
- Goods exchanged for goods
- Governed by Contract Act, not Sale of Goods Act
- Example: Exchanging a cow for a horse

**Part Exchange:**
- If consideration is partly goods and partly money, it is treated as sale
- Example: Old car + Tk. 500,000 for new car = Sale

#### 2. Sale vs. Bailment

**Sale:**
- Ownership transfers
- Seller transfers property rights
- Price is paid
- Example: Buying a book from a shop

**Bailment:**
- Only possession transfers, not ownership
- Temporary transfer for specific purpose
- Goods must be returned
- Example: Renting a car, depositing goods in warehouse

#### 3. Sale vs. Hire Purchase

**Sale:**
- Ownership transfers immediately (or at agreed time)
- Buyer becomes owner

**Hire Purchase:**
- Goods are hired with option to purchase
- Ownership transfers only when all installments are paid and option is exercised
- Until then, it remains bailment
- Hirer can return goods and terminate agreement
- Example: Buying refrigerator on installments from electronics store

**Key Difference**: In hire purchase, the hirer is not bound to purchase; in sale, buyer must purchase.

#### 4. Sale vs. Mortgage

**Sale:**
- Absolute transfer of ownership
- No right of redemption

**Mortgage:**
- Transfer of interest in property as security for debt
- Ownership can be redeemed by paying debt
- Primary object is security, not sale

#### 5. Sale vs. Gift

**Sale:**
- Consideration (price) is essential
- Transfer for value

**Gift:**
- No consideration
- Gratuitous transfer
- Requires acceptance by donee

#### 6. Sale vs. Contract for Work and Labour (Service Contract)

**Sale:**
- Transfer of existing or identified goods
- Goods are primary, skill is secondary
- Governed by Sale of Goods Act

**Work and Labour Contract:**
- Primary object is skill and labor
- Materials are secondary
- Governed by Contract Act
- Example: Hiring a painter to paint your house

**Test to Distinguish**: 
- If the essence is transfer of goods = Sale
- If the essence is exercise of skill = Work and labour

**Examples:**
- Ordering food at restaurant (cooked by chef) = Sale (goods primary)
- Hiring architect to design house = Service contract (skill primary)
- Ordering custom-made furniture = Sale (goods primary, though skill involved)
- Hiring carpenter to repair furniture = Service (skill primary)

---

## 3. Transfer of Ownership (Property in Goods)

The transfer of **property** (ownership) in goods is one of the most important aspects of a sale contract. "Property" here means **ownership**, not physical possession.

### 3.1 Importance of Transfer of Property

**Why is determining the time of transfer important?**

1. **Risk**: Generally, risk follows ownership (res perit domino - the thing perishes with the owner)
2. **Insolvency**: If either party becomes insolvent, ownership determines rights
3. **Rights of Action**: Owner can sue third parties for damage to goods
4. **Right to Resell**: Only owner can resell goods
5. **Price vs. Damages**: In sale, buyer pays price; in agreement to sell, breach gives only damages

### 3.2 General Rule: Intention of Parties (Section 19)

**Section 19(1)**: "Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred."

**Section 19(2)**: "For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of the case."

**Key Point**: The parties' **intention** determines when property transfers. This intention may be:
- **Express**: Clearly stated in the contract
- **Implied**: Inferred from conduct and circumstances

If the intention cannot be determined, the Act provides specific rules (Sections 20-24).

### 3.3 Specific Rules for Transfer of Property

When parties' intention is not clear, the following rules apply:

#### Rule 1: Transfer of Property in Specific or Ascertained Goods (Section 20)

**"Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of the price or the time of delivery of the goods, or both, be postponed."**

**Conditions for Application:**
1. Contract must be for **specific or ascertained goods**
2. Contract must be **unconditional**
3. Goods must be in **deliverable state**

**Deliverable State**: Goods are in such a state that the buyer would be bound to take delivery of them under the contract.

**Example**: A agrees to sell a specific car (DM-1234) to B for Tk. 1,000,000. The car is in deliverable condition. Property passes to B immediately when the contract is made, even if:
- Payment is to be made later
- Delivery is postponed
- B has not taken possession

**Effect**: If the car is destroyed by accident after the contract but before delivery, the loss falls on B (buyer), not A (seller).

#### Rule 2: Specific Goods Requiring Something to be Done (Section 21)

**"Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing be done and the buyer has notice thereof."**

**Conditions:**
1. Specific goods
2. Seller must do something to put goods in deliverable state
3. That thing must be completed
4. Buyer must have notice of completion

**Example**: A agrees to sell a specific machine to B for Tk. 500,000. The machine needs to be repaired before delivery. Property passes to B only when:
- The repairs are completed, AND
- B is informed of the completion

#### Rule 3: Specific Goods in Deliverable State - Weighing, Testing, etc. (Section 22)

**"Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing be done and the buyer has notice thereof."**

**Conditions:**
1. Specific goods in deliverable state
2. Seller must do something to ascertain the price (weigh, measure, test)
3. That act must be completed
4. Buyer must have notice

**Example**: A agrees to sell rice to B at Tk. 50 per kg. The rice needs to be weighed to determine the total price. Property passes to B only after:
- The rice is weighed, AND
- B is informed

**Distinction from Rule 2**: 
- Rule 2: Action needed to make goods deliverable
- Rule 3: Action needed to ascertain price (goods already deliverable)

#### Rule 4: Sale or Return / Sale on Approval (Section 23)

**"When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or 'on sale or return' or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer:**
**a) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the transaction;**
**b) If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection, then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expiration of such time, and, if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time."**

**Characteristics:**
- Goods delivered to buyer for approval
- Buyer has option to return
- Property transfers only when buyer accepts or time expires

**Property Passes When:**
1. Buyer expressly approves/accepts, OR
2. Buyer does any act adopting the transaction (e.g., resells the goods, pledges them), OR
3. Buyer retains goods beyond:
   - Fixed time (if time was specified), or
   - Reasonable time (if no time specified)

**Example**: A sends a laptop to B "on approval" for 7 days. Property passes to B if:
- B informs A that the laptop is approved, OR
- B sells or pledges the laptop, OR
- B keeps the laptop beyond 7 days without returning it

**What is "Reasonable Time"?**
Depends on:
- Nature of goods
- Custom and usage
- Circumstances of the case

#### Rule 5: Unascertained or Future Goods (Section 23)

**"Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be express or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made."**

**Key Concept: Appropriation**

**Appropriation** means setting apart or identifying specific goods as those to be delivered under the contract.

**Conditions for Transfer:**
1. Contract for unascertained or future goods
2. Goods of contract description
3. Goods in deliverable state
4. **Unconditional appropriation** to the contract
5. With assent of the other party (express or implied)

**Example**: A agrees to sell 100 bags of rice (unascertained) to B. A has 1,000 bags in the warehouse. Property passes when:
- A sets apart 100 specific bags for B, AND
- The bags are in deliverable state, AND
- B assents to this appropriation

**Modes of Appropriation:**

**(a) Delivery to Carrier**
"Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract."

**Example**: A sells goods to B in Dhaka. A is in Chittagong. A delivers the goods to a transport company for delivery to B without reserving any rights. Property passes to B when goods are delivered to the carrier.

**Reservation of Right of Disposal (Section 25):**
- Seller may reserve the right of disposal until certain conditions are fulfilled
- Common in international trade (documents against payment)
- Property does not pass until conditions are met

**Example**: A ships goods to B and sends the bill of lading to B's bank with instructions to release it only upon payment. Property passes only when B pays and gets the documents.

### 3.4 Transfer of Property: Special Cases

#### 1. Sale of Goods in Transit

When goods are in transit (being transported), property may pass even though buyer hasn't received them.

#### 2. Risk and Property

**General Rule**: Risk follows property (res perit domino)

**Section 26**: "Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller's risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer's risk whether delivery has been made or not."

**Exceptions:**

**(a) Delay in Delivery (Section 26, Proviso 1)**
If delivery is delayed through the fault of either party, goods are at the risk of the party at fault.

**Example**: Seller has appropriated goods to buyer, but buyer delays taking delivery. Goods are accidentally destroyed. Buyer bears the loss.

**(b) Delivery to Carrier (Section 26, Proviso 2)**
If seller delivers to carrier, risk may pass even if property has not.

#### 3. Sale by Non-Owner (Sections 27-30)

**General Rule (Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet - Section 27):**
"Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other law for the time being in force, where goods are sold by a person who is not the owner thereof, and who does not sell them under the authority or with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better title to the goods than the seller had."

**Principle**: No one can give a better title than they have themselves.

**Example**: If A steals B's car and sells it to C, C does not become the owner. B can recover the car from C.

**Exceptions (When Buyer Gets Good Title Even from Non-Owner):**

**(a) Sale by Mercantile Agent (Section 27)**
- If goods are sold by a mercantile agent in ordinary course of business
- Buyer gets good title if:
  - Seller is a mercantile agent
  - Agent has possession with owner's consent
  - Sale is in ordinary course of business
  - Buyer acts in good faith

**(b) Sale by Joint Owner (Section 28)**
- If one of several joint owners has sole possession with consent of others
- Can give valid title to a buyer who buys in good faith

**(c) Sale by Person in Possession Under Voidable Contract (Section 29)**
- If seller obtained goods under a voidable contract
- But the contract has not been rescinded at the time of sale
- Buyer gets good title if they buy in good faith and without notice of defect

**Example**: A induces B to sell goods through misrepresentation. Before B rescinds the contract, A sells to C (who acts in good faith). C gets good title.

**(d) Sale by Seller in Possession After Sale (Section 30(1))**
- If seller, after selling goods, continues in possession
- Sells or pledges to another person
- Second buyer gets good title if they buy in good faith and without notice of previous sale

**Example**: A sells goods to B but retains possession. A sells the same goods to C who buys in good faith. C gets good title.

**(e) Sale by Buyer in Possession Before Property Passes (Section 30(2))**
- If buyer, with seller's consent, obtains possession before property passes
- Buyer sells or pledges to a third party
- Third party gets good title if they buy in good faith and without notice

**Example**: A agrees to sell goods to B. B gets possession but ownership has not yet transferred. B sells to C (who acts in good faith). C gets good title.

**(f) Estoppel (Section 27, Proviso)**
- If the owner by their conduct is precluded (estopped) from denying seller's authority
- Buyer gets good title

**Example**: A allows B to appear as owner of goods. B sells to C. A cannot later claim the goods from C.

**(g) Sale Under Statutory Authority**
- Sales by official receivers, liquidators, court orders
- Valid even if seller is not owner

---

## 4. Performance of Contract of Sale

Performance of a contract of sale involves the **delivery of goods** by the seller and **payment of price** by the buyer.

### 4.1 Duties of Seller and Buyer (Section 31)

**Section 31(1)**: "It is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods and of the buyer to accept and pay for them, in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale."

**Seller's Primary Duties:**
1. Deliver the goods
2. Transfer property (ownership)
3. Hand over documents of title (if any)

**Buyer's Primary Duties:**
1. Accept delivery
2. Pay the price

### 4.2 Delivery of Goods

#### Meaning of Delivery (Section 2(2))

"Delivery means voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another."

Delivery is not just physical handing over; it includes any method by which possession is transferred.

#### Rules Regarding Delivery

**1. Payment and Delivery are Concurrent Conditions (Section 32)**

"Unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions, that is to say, the seller must be ready and willing to give possession of the goods to the buyer in exchange for the price, and the buyer must be ready and willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of the goods."

**Effect**: 
- Seller can refuse delivery until payment is made
- Buyer can refuse payment until delivery is offered

**Exception**: When credit is agreed upon, payment is postponed.

**2. Delivery to be Made on Buyer's Application (Section 33)**

"Where the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods, and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time after such request take delivery of the goods, he is liable to the seller for any loss occasioned by his neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable charge for the care and custody of the goods."

If buyer delays taking delivery unreasonably:
- Buyer liable for any loss
- Buyer must pay storage/custody charges

**3. Place of Delivery (Section 36)**

**Default Rule**: Goods must be delivered at the seller's place of business (if any), or at seller's residence.

**Exceptions:**
- If a specific place is agreed upon, delivery at that place
- If goods are at a different place at the time of contract and parties know this, delivery at that place

**Example**: A in Dhaka sells goods stored in a Chittagong warehouse to B. Delivery should be at the Chittagong warehouse.

**4. Time of Delivery (Section 37)**

- Delivery must be within a reasonable time (if no time specified)
- What is "reasonable" depends on circumstances
- If time is specified:
  - In commercial contracts, time is usually of the essence
  - In other contracts, time may not be of the essence unless expressly stated

**5. Delivery of Wrong Quantity (Sections 38, 39, 40)**

**(a) Delivery of Smaller Quantity (Section 38)**
If seller delivers less than contracted:
- Buyer may reject the whole, OR
- Accept what is delivered and pay proportionate price

**Example**: Contract for 100 bags, only 90 delivered. Buyer can:
- Reject all 90 bags, OR
- Accept 90 bags and pay for 90 bags only

**(b) Delivery of Larger Quantity (Section 39)**
If seller delivers more than contracted:
- Buyer may:
  - Reject the whole, OR
  - Accept the contracted quantity and reject the rest, OR
  - Accept the whole and pay for the extra at contract rate

**Example**: Contract for 100 bags, 110 delivered. Buyer can:
- Reject all 110 bags, OR
- Accept 100 bags and reject 10, OR
- Accept all 110 and pay for 110

**(c) Delivery of Goods Mixed with Other Goods (Section 40)**
If seller delivers contracted goods mixed with goods of a different description:
- Buyer may:
  - Reject the whole, OR
  - Accept the contracted goods and reject the rest

**Example**: Contract for 100 bags of Basmati rice. Seller delivers 80 bags of Basmati mixed with 20 bags of ordinary rice. Buyer can:
- Reject all, OR
- Accept 80 bags of Basmati and reject 20 bags of ordinary rice

**6. Delivery in Installments (Section 43)**

"Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer is not bound to accept delivery by installments."

**Default Rule**: Goods must be delivered in one lot.

**Exception**: If installment delivery is agreed:
- Each installment is treated as a separate contract
- Breach of one installment may or may not affect the whole contract depending on circumstances

**7. Goods in Possession of Third Party (Section 34)**

When goods are in possession of a third party (e.g., warehouse, bailee):
- Delivery is complete when the third party acknowledges to the buyer that they hold goods on buyer's behalf
- No need for physical transfer

**8. Delivery by Seller in Advance (Section 35)**

"Apart from any express contract, the buyer is not bound to return rejected goods to the seller, but it is sufficient if he intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them."

If buyer rightfully rejects goods:
- Buyer need not return them to seller
- Simply giving notice of rejection is sufficient
- Seller must collect them

**9. Buyer's Right to Examine Goods (Section 41)**

"Where goods are delivered to the buyer, which he has not previously examined, he is not deemed to have accepted them unless and until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract."

**Rights of Buyer:**
- Right to examine goods before acceptance
- Right to verify conformity with contract
- Reasonable opportunity must be given

**10. Acceptance of Goods (Section 42)**

The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he:
- **(a) Intimates acceptance to seller**, OR
- **(b) Does any act inconsistent with seller's ownership** (e.g., resells, alters the goods), OR
- **(c) Retains goods beyond reasonable time without intimating rejection**

**Effect of Acceptance:**
- Buyer cannot later reject goods
- Buyer can still claim damages for breach of warranty

**Exception**: Buyer can reject even after acceptance if there is a breach of condition that was not apparent on reasonable examination.

#### Types of Delivery

**1. Actual Delivery**
- Physical handing over of goods
- Most common type
- Goods physically transferred from seller to buyer

**2. Symbolic Delivery**
- Transfer of documents of title represents delivery
- Common in international trade
- Examples: Bill of lading, warehouse receipt, delivery order

**Example**: A in Bangladesh sells goods to B in UK. A hands over the bill of lading to B. This constitutes delivery even though goods are still on the ship.

**3. Constructive Delivery**
- Transfer of means of control over goods
- No physical movement of goods
- Examples:
  - Delivery of keys to warehouse
  - Goods stored in buyer's warehouse on seller's behalf are now held on buyer's behalf (attornment)

**4. Delivery by Attornment (Section 34)**
- When a third party holding goods acknowledges that they now hold on behalf of the buyer
- Bailee "attorns" to the buyer

**Example**: A's goods are in X's warehouse. A sells to B. X acknowledges to B that goods are now held for B. Delivery is complete.

### 4.3 Unpaid Seller's Rights

An **unpaid seller** has special rights against the goods and against the buyer.

#### Who is an Unpaid Seller? (Section 45)

A seller is deemed to be an unpaid seller when:
- The whole price has not been paid or tendered, OR
- A bill of exchange or negotiable instrument received as conditional payment has been dishonored

#### Rights of Unpaid Seller

**A. Rights Against the Goods (Sections 47-54)**

**1. Right of Lien (Section 47)**

The unpaid seller has a **lien** (right to retain possession) over the goods until payment, even though property has passed to the buyer.

**When Right of Lien Arises:**
- Goods sold without stipulation as to credit, OR
