## 1. Definition of Frustration

- **Frustration** is a **psychological state** that arises when an individual’s **goals, needs, or desires are blocked or prevented**.
- It occurs when employees are **unable to achieve expected outcomes** despite effort, skills, or motivation.
- In the workplace, frustration can result from obstacles like:
  - Unclear job roles
  - Excessive workload
  - Lack of promotion opportunities
  - Conflicts with supervisors or colleagues
  - Organizational policies or resource constraints

**Key insight:** Frustration is not always negative. Mild frustration can motivate problem-solving, but chronic frustration may lead to negative behaviors.

## 2. Symptoms of Frustration in Employees

Frustration manifests in **behavioral, emotional, and physiological symptoms**. Common signs include:

### A. Aggression

- **Examples:**
  - Yelling at colleagues or subordinates
  - Blaming others for failures
  - Destroying office property (e.g., slamming doors, breaking equipment)
- **Psychological basis:** Unmet goals create tension, leading to anger and impulsive reactions.

### B. Withdrawal
- **Definition:** Emotional or physical distancing from work, tasks, or colleagues.
- **Examples:**

2. **Emotion-Focused Coping**
   - Manage emotional responses rather than the cause.

   - Example: Discuss workload concerns with a manager.

4. **Time Management and Prioritization**
