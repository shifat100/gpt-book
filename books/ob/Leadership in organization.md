## 5. Overview of Major Leadership Theories

### A. Trait Theory
- Leaders possess **innate qualities** that distinguish them from non-leaders.
- Key traits: intelligence, confidence, integrity, sociability.

  2. **People-Oriented:** Focus on employee needs and relationships.
- Example: A manager balancing deadlines (task) and team support (people).

### C. Contingency Theories
- Leadership effectiveness depends on **situational factors**.
- **Fiedler’s Contingency Model:** Match leader style (task vs. relationship oriented) with situational favorableness.
- **Path-Goal Theory:** Leaders adjust behavior to help employees achieve goals.

### D. Transformational Leadership
- Inspires followers to **exceed expectations** by creating a vision and fostering commitment.
- Characteristics: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.
- Example: Steve Jobs inspiring innovation at Apple.

### E. Transactional Leadership
- Focuses on **exchanging rewards for performance**.
- Emphasizes **structure, rules, and clear expectations**.
- Example: Managers providing bonuses for meeting targets.

### F. Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Theory
