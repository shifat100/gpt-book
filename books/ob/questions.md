**(b) Money or financial benefit is the only motivating factor. Do you agree? Why?**
*   **Disagree.** While money is a crucial "Hygiene factor" (Herzberg), it prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't always motivate. People are also motivated by achievement, recognition, responsibility, and growth (Motivators).

**14. (a) What are the Causes of frustration?**
*   External: Physical barriers, rigid rules, lack of resources.
*   Internal: Lack of ability, low confidence, conflicting personal goals.

    5.  **Self-Actualization:** Potential (Creative freedom).
**(b) Explain Herzberg two factor theories with example.**
