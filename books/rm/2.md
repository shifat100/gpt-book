## 2.1 Introduction to Life Assurance

**Life Assurance** (also called Life Insurance) is a contract between a policyholder and an insurer where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money upon the death of the insured person or after a specified period. In exchange, the policyholder pays premiums either regularly or as a lump sum.

### 2.1.1 Distinguishing Terms: Assurance vs. Insurance

While often used interchangeably, there is a technical distinction:

| **Life Assurance** | **Life Insurance** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Covers an event that **will certainly happen** (death) | Covers an event that **may or may not happen** (accident, illness) |
| Pays benefit upon certainty (death is inevitable) | Pays benefit upon uncertainty (loss may not occur) |
| Examples: Whole life, endowment policies | Examples: Term insurance, health insurance |
| Traditional British terminology | American and modern usage |

**Modern Practice:** The terms are now used interchangeably in most markets, including Bangladesh. "Life insurance" is the more common term globally.

### 2.1.2 Purpose and Importance of Life Insurance

**Primary Purposes:**

1. **Financial Protection for Dependents:** Provides income replacement when the breadwinner dies
2. **Debt Repayment:** Ensures mortgages and loans can be paid if the insured dies
3. **Estate Planning:** Provides liquidity to pay estate taxes and preserve wealth for heirs
4. **Savings and Investment:** Many policies combine protection with savings accumulation
5. **Business Continuity:** Protects businesses from loss of key personnel
6. **Retirement Planning:** Builds funds for retirement through cash value accumulation

**Real-World Application:**

*Scenario:* Mr. Hasan, age 35, is the sole earner for his family (wife and two children, ages 5 and 7). He earns $24,000 annually. If he dies unexpectedly:

*Without Life Insurance:*
- Family loses all income immediately
- Children's education at risk
- May need to sell home or other assets
- Wife may need to work immediately under financial pressure
- Reduced standard of living

*With Life Insurance ($300,000 policy):*
- Death benefit provides immediate financial cushion
- Invested conservatively (5% return), generates $15,000 annual income
- Children's education secured
- Family maintains home and stability
- Time to adjust and plan for the future

## 2.2 The Life Insurance Contract

### 2.2.1 Nature of Life Insurance Contracts

Life insurance contracts possess all the characteristics of general insurance contracts (discussed in Chapter 1) plus some unique features:

#### **Special Characteristics:**

**1. Long-Term Contract**

Life insurance policies typically extend for many years, often decades or even the entire lifetime of the insured.

**Implication:** 
- Requires long-term financial planning from insurers
- Premium calculations must account for future uncertainties
- Investment management becomes critical

**Example:** A 25-year-old purchasing whole life insurance may hold the policy for 50+ years, requiring the insurer to maintain financial stability over generations.

**2. Conditional Contract with Exception**

While generally conditional (premiums must be paid), there's an important exception:

**Grace Period:** Most policies provide a grace period (typically 30 days) during which coverage continues even if premium payment is late.

**Automatic Premium Loan:** Some policies allow the insurer to automatically borrow against cash value to pay premiums if the policyholder misses payments.

**Example:** Mr. Rahman forgets to pay his June premium due June 1. The policy remains in force until June 30 (grace period). If he dies during this time, the death benefit is paid (minus the unpaid premium).

**3. Valued Contract (Not Indemnity)**

Unlike property insurance, life insurance does NOT follow the principle of indemnity. The policy pays the stated sum assured regardless of "actual financial loss."

**Rationale:** Human life cannot be valued in monetary terms. The death benefit is a pre-agreed amount, not compensation for measurable financial loss.

**Example:** 
- Ms. Akter purchases a $200,000 life insurance policy
- Upon her death, her family receives exactly $200,000
- This amount is NOT adjusted based on her actual financial contribution to the family
- If she had two policies totaling $400,000, both pay in full (no contribution principle applies)

**4. Requires Insurable Interest Only at Inception**

For life insurance, insurable interest must exist **when the policy is purchased** but need not exist at the time of death.

**Example:**
- Business partners purchase key person insurance on each other
- They dissolve the partnership five years later
- Original policy remains valid even though the business relationship no longer exists
- If one partner dies, the policy still pays

**Contrast with Property Insurance:** Property insurance requires insurable interest both at inception and at time of loss.

**5. Beneficiary Designation**

Life insurance involves three parties:
- **Policyholder:** Owns the policy and pays premiums (may be different from insured)
- **Insured:** Person whose life is covered
- **Beneficiary:** Person who receives the death benefit

**Flexibility:** The policyholder can generally change the beneficiary designation at any time (unless designated as irrevocable beneficiary).

**Example:**
- Mr. Karim purchases life insurance naming his wife as beneficiary
- After divorce, he changes the beneficiary to his children
- Later, he remarries and adds his new wife as co-beneficiary with his children
- This flexibility allows the policy to adapt to life changes

### 2.2.2 Essential Elements of Life Insurance Contracts

Beyond the general contract elements (Chapter 1), life insurance contracts contain:

**1. Policy Schedule/Declarations**
- Insured's name, age, and date of birth
- Sum assured (face value)
- Premium amount and payment frequency
- Policy term and commencement date
- Beneficiary designation
- Any special conditions or exclusions

**2. Proposal Form Information**
- Medical history and current health status
- Occupation and income
- Lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol, hazardous activities)
- Family medical history
- Previous insurance applications and claims

**3. Standard Provisions**

**Incontestability Clause:**
After the policy has been in force for a specified period (typically 2 years), the insurer cannot contest the policy based on misrepresentation (except for fraud).

**Purpose:** Provides security to beneficiaries; prevents insurers from investigating after many years of premium payments.

**Example:** Mr. Ahmed's policy has been in force for 5 years. He dies, and during claims investigation, the insurer discovers he understated his age by 2 years on the application. Because of the incontestability clause, the insurer cannot void the policy but may adjust the benefit based on the correct age.

**Suicide Clause:**
Most policies exclude suicide for a specific period (typically 1-2 years) from policy inception. If the insured commits suicide during this period, only premiums paid are returned.

**Purpose:** Prevents people from purchasing insurance with intent to commit suicide, reducing moral hazard.

**Example:** 
- Policy issued January 1, 2023, with 2-year suicide exclusion
- If insured commits suicide on March 1, 2024 (within 2 years): Only premiums returned
- If insured commits suicide on February 1, 2025 (after 2 years): Full death benefit paid

**Grace Period:**
Typically 30 days beyond the premium due date during which the policy remains in force.

**Reinstatement Clause:**
If a policy lapses due to non-payment, the policyholder can reinstate it within a certain period (often 2-3 years) by:
- Paying all overdue premiums (possibly with interest)
- Providing evidence of continued insurability
- Meeting any other conditions specified

**Free-Look Period:**
New policyholders have a specified period (typically 15-30 days) to review the policy and return it for a full refund if unsatisfied.

**Purpose:** Consumer protection; ensures people understand what they purchased.

**4. Standard Exclusions**

Common exclusions include:
- **War and Military Service:** Death due to war or military operations (in some policies)
- **Aviation (non-commercial):** Death while piloting private aircraft
- **Hazardous Activities:** Death during specific excluded activities (mountaineering, motor racing)
- **Criminal Activity:** Death while committing a crime
- **Pre-existing Conditions:** May be excluded or require higher premiums (health-related policies)

**Important:** Exclusions must be clearly stated in the policy. Ambiguities are interpreted in favor of the insured.

### 2.2.3 Assignment and Nomination

**Assignment:**

**Definition:** Transfer of ownership rights in the policy from one person to another.

**Types:**

**Absolute Assignment:**
- Complete transfer of all policy rights
- Original owner has no further control
- Common for gifts or sale of policy

**Example:** Mr. Rahim assigns his life insurance policy absolutely to his son. The son now owns the policy, can change beneficiaries, borrow against it, or surrender it.

**Conditional Assignment:**
- Temporary transfer for specific purpose
- Rights return to original owner when condition is satisfied
- Common for collateral/loan security

**Example:** Ms. Sultana assigns her policy to a bank as collateral for a business loan. When the loan is repaid, the assignment is cancelled and rights return to her.

**Nomination:**

**Definition:** Designation of a person to receive policy proceeds upon the insured's death. A nominee is NOT the owner of the policy; they are simply appointed to receive the benefit.

**Key Difference from Assignment:**

| **Assignment** | **Nomination** |
|---------------|---------------|
| Transfer of ownership | Designation of beneficiary only |
| Assignee owns the policy | Nominee receives proceeds but doesn't own policy |
| Can be done during lifetime for various purposes | Takes effect only upon death |
| Requires insurer's consent and endorsement | Simple declaration by policyholder |

**Example:** Mr. Karim nominates his wife to receive his life insurance proceeds. He still owns the policy during his lifetime and can change the nomination, borrow against it, or surrender it. His wife has no rights until his death.

## 2.3 Kinds of Life Insurance Policies and Annuities

Life insurance policies can be categorized based on various features: duration of coverage, purpose, premium payment structure, and participation in profits.

### 2.3.1 Classification of Life Insurance Policies

#### **Based on Duration of Coverage:**

### **A. Term Insurance**

**Definition:** Provides coverage for a specific period (term). If the insured dies during the term, the death benefit is paid. If the insured survives the term, no benefit is paid (pure protection with no savings element).

**Key Features:**
- Pure risk coverage (no investment component)
- Lowest premium rates
- No cash value accumulation
- Coverage expires at end of term
- Renewable and convertible options available

**Types of Term Insurance:**

**1. Level Term Insurance:**
- Death benefit remains constant throughout the term
- Premium typically level

**Example:** $200,000 coverage for 20 years at $500 annual premium.

**2. Decreasing Term Insurance:**
- Death benefit decreases over time (usually annually)
- Premium remains level or decreases
- Common for mortgage protection

**Example:** Initial coverage $300,000, decreasing by $15,000 annually for 20 years. If death occurs in Year 5, benefit is $300,000 - (4 × $15,000) = $225,000.

**3. Increasing Term Insurance:**
- Death benefit increases over time
- Premium increases accordingly
- Protects against inflation

**Example:** Initial coverage $100,000, increasing by 5% annually.

**4. Renewable Term:**
- Can be renewed at end of term without medical examination
- Premium increases at each renewal based on attained age

**5. Convertible Term:**
- Can be converted to permanent insurance without medical evidence
- Typically within specified conversion period

**Advantages of Term Insurance:**
- ✓ Most affordable coverage
- ✓ Provides maximum protection for premium paid
- ✓ Ideal for temporary needs (young families, loan protection)
- ✓ Simple and easy to understand

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No cash value or savings component
- ✗ Coverage ends at term expiry
- ✗ Premium increases significantly if renewed at older ages
- ✗ May not be renewable if health deteriorates

**Ideal For:**
- Young families needing high coverage on limited budget
- Mortgage or loan protection
- Temporary coverage needs
- Supplementing permanent insurance

**Real-World Example:**

*Mr. Hasan, age 30, has a $200,000 mortgage with 20 years remaining. He purchases 20-year decreasing term insurance matching his mortgage balance.*

**Rationale:**
- Affordable premium (approximately $300-400 annually)
- Coverage decreases as mortgage balance decreases
- If he dies, mortgage is fully paid off
- After 20 years, mortgage is paid and insurance is no longer needed

### **B. Whole Life Insurance**

**Definition:** Provides lifetime coverage. The policy remains in force as long as premiums are paid, and pays the death benefit whenever death occurs (no matter the age).

**Key Features:**
- Permanent coverage (entire life)
- Combines protection with savings/cash value accumulation
- Level premiums throughout life (or limited payment period)
- Cash value that grows tax-deferred
- Can borrow against cash value
- Participating policies share in company profits (bonuses/dividends)

**Types of Whole Life Insurance:**

**1. Ordinary/Straight Life:**
- Premiums paid throughout the insured's lifetime
- Coverage and premiums remain level
- Most common form of whole life

**Example:** $100,000 whole life policy purchased at age 30. Premium $1,500 annually, payable until death. Death benefit paid regardless of when death occurs (age 45, 70, or 95).

**2. Limited Payment Life:**
- Premiums paid for specified period only
- Coverage continues for life
- Common periods: 10-pay, 20-pay, paid-up at 65

**Example:** 20-Pay Life: $100,000 coverage. Pay premiums for 20 years only. After 20 years, policy is "paid up" and coverage continues for life without further premiums.

**Benefit:** Eliminates premium burden during retirement years.

**3. Single Premium Life:**
- Entire premium paid in one lump sum at inception
- Immediate full coverage
- Immediate cash value accumulation

**Example:** $100,000 coverage purchased with single premium of $40,000 at age 45. No further premiums ever required.

**4. Modified/Graded Premium Life:**
- Premiums start lower and increase over time
- Useful for young people expecting income growth
- Eventually reaches level premium

**Advantages of Whole Life:**
- ✓ Lifetime guaranteed coverage
- ✓ Cash value accumulation (savings component)
- ✓ Level premiums (budgeting certainty)
- ✓ Can borrow against cash value
- ✓ Participating policies receive bonuses
- ✓ Estate planning benefits

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Higher premiums than term insurance
- ✗ Less flexibility than universal life
- ✗ Lower returns compared to direct investments
- ✗ Complex surrender charges if cancelled early

**Cash Value Illustration:**

*$100,000 Whole Life Policy, Age 30, $1,800 Annual Premium:*

| **Year** | **Premium Paid** | **Cash Value** | **Death Benefit** |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $1,800 | $0 | $100,000 |
| 5 | $9,000 | $4,500 | $100,000 |
| 10 | $18,000 | $12,000 | $100,000 |
| 20 | $36,000 | $32,000 | $100,000 |
| 30 | $54,000 | $58,000 | $100,000 |
| 40 | $72,000 | $88,000 | $100,000 |

**Note:** These are illustrative figures. Actual cash values depend on company performance, assumed interest rates, and policy expenses.

**Policy Loans:**
- Can borrow against accumulated cash value
- Typically up to 90-95% of cash value
- Interest charged on loan (but policy continues earning)
- Loan reduces death benefit if not repaid

**Example:** After 20 years, policy has $32,000 cash value. Policyholder borrows $25,000 at 6% interest. If death occurs before repayment, death benefit is reduced: $100,000 - $25,000 - accrued interest = net benefit.

**Ideal For:**
- Long-term financial planning
- Estate planning and wealth transfer
- Individuals seeking guaranteed lifetime protection
- Those wanting forced savings discipline
- Business key person insurance

### **C. Endowment Insurance**

**Definition:** Provides coverage for a specific period, but pays the sum assured either upon death during the term OR upon survival to the end of the term (maturity). Combines protection with guaranteed savings.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed term (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25 years)
- Pays on death OR maturity (whichever comes first)
- Highest premium among traditional policies
- Significant savings/investment component
- Guaranteed maturity benefit
- Popular for specific financial goals

**Structure:**
- If insured dies during term → Death benefit paid to beneficiary
- If insured survives term → Maturity benefit paid to policyholder

**Types of Endowment Insurance:**

**1. Pure Endowment:**
- Pays only if insured survives to maturity
- No death benefit
- Rare in practice (not truly insurance)

**Example:** $50,000 pure endowment, 20-year term. If insured survives 20 years, receives $50,000. If death occurs during 20 years, nothing is paid.

**2. Endowment Assurance (Standard):**
- Most common form
- Pays sum assured on death OR maturity

**Example:** $50,000 endowment, 20-year term:
- Death in Year 8 → $50,000 paid to beneficiary
- Survival to Year 20 → $50,000 paid to policyholder

**3. Low-Cost Endowment:**
- Combines decreasing term insurance with investment fund
- Lower premiums than standard endowment
- Death benefit varies; maturity benefit targeted

**Advantages of Endowment:**
- ✓ Guaranteed return (maturity benefit)
- ✓ Forced savings discipline
- ✓ Dual benefit (protection + savings)
- ✓ Goal-oriented (education, retirement, marriage)
- ✓ Cash value accumulation
- ✓ Tax benefits (in many jurisdictions)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Highest premiums among life policies
- ✗ Lower returns compared to direct market investments
- ✗ Less flexibility
- ✗ Significant loss if surrendered early

**Maturity Benefit Calculation:**

**Simple Example:**

*$100,000 Endowment Policy, 20-Year Term, Annual Premium $4,000:*

**Basic Maturity Value:** $100,000 (Sum Assured)

**Plus: Accumulated Bonuses:**
- Simple bonus: $1,000 per year × 20 years = $20,000
- Terminal bonus (end of term): $15,000

**Total Maturity Benefit:** $100,000 + $20,000 + $15,000 = **$135,000**

**Note:** Actual bonuses depend on company performance and are declared periodically.

**Common Uses:**

**Children's Education Planning:**

*Example:* Mr. Rahman's daughter is 5 years old. He wants $50,000 for her university education in 15 years. He purchases a 15-year endowment policy:
- If he dies before maturity → $50,000 ensures education is funded
- If he survives → $50,000 (plus bonuses) available for her education

**Retirement Planning:**

*Example:* Ms. Akter, age 40, plans to retire at 60. She purchases a 20-year endowment:
- Provides life coverage during working years
- Guaranteed lump sum at retirement
- Can be used to supplement pension

**Marriage Fund:**

*Example:* Parents purchase 15-year endowment when child is born to fund future marriage expenses.

**Ideal For:**
- Specific financial goals with target dates
- Individuals seeking guaranteed savings
- Conservative investors wanting predictability
- Parents planning for children's future
- Those requiring disciplined savings

### **D. Money-Back Policy**

**Definition:** A variation of endowment that pays periodic survival benefits (typically a percentage of sum assured) during the policy term, while maintaining full death benefit throughout. Provides liquidity during the policy term.

**Key Features:**
- Periodic payments during policy term (e.g., every 5 years)
- Full death benefit throughout term regardless of survival payments
- Maturity benefit at end
- Higher premiums than standard endowment

**Example Structure:**

*$100,000 Money-Back Policy, 20-Year Term:*

| **Year** | **Event** | **Payment** | **Remaining Death Benefit** |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 5 | Survival | $20,000 | $100,000 |
| 10 | Survival | $20,000 | $100,000 |
| 15 | Survival | $20,000 | $100,000 |
| 20 | Maturity | $40,000 + Bonuses | N/A |

**Important:** If death occurs at any time during the term, full $100,000 is paid (not reduced by survival benefits already received).

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Regular liquidity during policy term
- ✓ Full death benefit maintained
- ✓ Meets intermediate financial needs
- ✓ Good for cash flow planning

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Highest premiums
- ✗ Survival payments may be spent rather than saved
- ✗ Lower overall returns
- ✗ Complex structure

**Ideal For:**
- Individuals needing periodic cash flows
- Multiple financial goals at different times
- Those who might otherwise surrender policy for cash needs

### 2.3.2 Annuities

**Definition:** An annuity is the opposite of life insurance. While life insurance protects against dying too soon, an annuity protects against living too long (outliving savings). An annuity provides regular income payments for a specified period or for life.

**Basic Concept:**
- **Life Insurance:** Pay premiums → Receive lump sum upon death
- **Annuity:** Pay lump sum (or premiums) → Receive regular income

**Parties to an Annuity:**
- **Annuitant:** Person whose life determines payment duration
- **Annuity Owner:** Person who purchased the annuity (may be same as annuitant)
- **Beneficiary:** Person who receives benefits if annuitant dies (in certain annuities)

### **Types of Annuities**

#### **A. Classification by Premium Payment:**

**1. Single Premium Annuity:**
- Purchase with one lump sum payment
- Immediate income starts

**Example:** Mr. Karim, retiring at 60, invests $200,000 lump sum to receive monthly income for life.

**2. Flexible Premium Annuity:**
- Purchase with series of payments over time
- Income deferred until later date

**Example:** Ms. Akter contributes $5,000 annually for 10 years, then begins receiving monthly income at age 65.

#### **B. Classification by Income Start Date:**

**1. Immediate Annuity:**
- Income begins immediately (within one year) after purchase
- Purchased with lump sum
- Common for retirees needing immediate income

**Example:** Upon retirement, Mr. Rahman converts retirement savings of $150,000 into immediate annuity providing $1,000 monthly for life.

**2. Deferred Annuity:**
- Income begins at future specified date
- Accumulation period followed by payout period
- Allows investment growth before income starts

**Example:** At age 45, Ms. Begum purchases deferred annuity that will begin paying at age 65—20-year accumulation period before income starts.

#### **C. Classification by Duration of Payments:**

**1. Life Annuity (Pure Life/Straight Life):**
- Payments continue for entire life of annuitant
- Highest periodic payment rate
- Payments stop at death (no residual value)

**Structure:** 
- Pay $100,000 → Receive $800/month for life
- If annuitant lives 30 years: Total received = $800 × 12 × 30 = $288,000 (great deal)
- If annuitant lives 5 years: Total received = $800 × 12 × 5 = $48,000 (lost $52,000)

**Risk:** If annuitant dies soon after purchase, much of investment is lost.

**Advantage:** Guarantees income that cannot be outlived; highest payment rate.

**Ideal For:** Single persons with no dependents; those primarily concerned with lifetime income.

**2. Life Annuity with Period Certain:**
- Payments for life but guaranteed minimum period
- If annuitant dies during guaranteed period, payments continue to beneficiary
- Lower payment rate than pure life

**Example:** Life annuity with 10-year period certain:
- Annuitant receives $750/month for life
- If death occurs in Year 7, beneficiary receives $750/month for remaining 3 years
- If annuitant lives beyond 10 years, payments continue for life

**Variants:**
- 5-year certain
- 10-year certain
- 15-year certain
- 20-year certain

**Advantage:** Provides protection against early death while maintaining lifetime income.

**3. Joint and Survivor Annuity:**
- Covers two lives (typically spouses)
- Payments continue until both annuitants die
- Options: full payments continue or reduced payments after first death

**Example - Full Joint and Survivor:**
- Mr. and Mrs. Hasan purchase annuity paying $1,500/month
- Payments continue at $1,500/month as long as either is alive
- Only stops when both have died

**Example - 50% Joint and Survivor:**
- Pays $1,800/month while both alive
- Reduces to $900/month (50%) after first death
- Continues to survivor for life

**Advantage:** Protects surviving spouse; ensures continuous income for couple.

**4. Term Certain Annuity:**
- Fixed period regardless of survival
- Pays specified period only (5, 10, 20 years)
- Not truly "insurance" (no life contingency)

**Example:** 15-year term certain annuity:
- Pays $1,000/month for exactly 15 years
- Continues to beneficiary if annuitant dies before 15 years
- Stops after 15 years even if annuitant alive

**Use:** Bridging specific time period (until pension starts, until mortgage paid off).

#### **D. Classification by Investment Type:**

**1. Fixed Annuity:**
- Guaranteed interest rate and payment amounts
- Insurer bears investment risk
- Predictable income
- Lower risk, lower potential return

**Example:** Guaranteed 4% annual return; $1,000 monthly payment fixed for life.

**2. Variable Annuity:**
- Payments vary based on investment performance
- Annuitant bears investment risk
- Potential for higher returns (and losses)
- Invested in mutual funds or similar instruments

**Example:** Monthly payment ranges from $800-$1,500 depending on market performance.

**3. Indexed Annuity:**
- Returns linked to market index (e.g., stock market index)
- Typically has minimum guarantee and maximum cap
- Balances growth potential with downside protection

**Example:** Return linked to stock market index with 2% floor (minimum) and 10% cap (maximum) annually.

### **Annuity Payment Calculation (Simplified)**

**Basic Formula Concept:**

The periodic payment from an annuity depends on:
- Purchase price (premium paid)
- Expected return/interest rate
- Life expectancy of annuitant
- Type of annuity (life, period certain, joint, etc.)

**Simplified Example:**

*Purchase Price:* $120,000  
*Interest Rate:* 5% annually  
*Life Expectancy:* 20 years  
*Type:* 20-year period certain

**Approximate Annual Payment:**

Using present value of annuity formula (simplified):
Payment ≈ $120,000 / 12.462 (present value factor for 20 years at 5%)  
Payment ≈ **$9,628 annually** or **$802 monthly**

**Note:** Actual calculations are more complex, involving mortality tables, expense loadings, and profit margins.

### **Comparison: Life Insurance vs. Annuity**

| **Aspect** | **Life Insurance** | **Annuity** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Protects against dying too soon | Protects against living too long |
| **Payment Direction** | Regular premiums → Lump sum benefit | Lump sum (or premiums) → Regular income |
| **Primary Risk** | Premature death | Outliving savings |
| **Beneficiary** | Pays to beneficiaries upon death | Pays to annuitant during life |
| **Typical Use** | Income replacement, debt protection | Retirement income, pension supplement |
| **Duration** | Limited term or whole life | Fixed period or lifetime income |

## 2.4 Mortality Tables

A **mortality table** (also called a life table or actuarial table) is a statistical table showing the probability of death at each age for a given population. It is the fundamental tool actuaries use to calculate life insurance premiums and reserves.

### 2.4.1 What is a Mortality Table?

**Definition:** A mortality table displays the probability that a person of a given age will die before their next birthday, along with related survival statistics.

**Purpose in Insurance:**
- Calculate premium rates
- Determine reserves
- Price annuities
- Assess risk accurately
- Ensure financial solvency

**Key Components of a Mortality Table:**

| **Column** | **Symbol** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Age | x | Attained age |
| Number Living | l_x | Number of people alive at age x |
| Number Dying | d_x | Number of people dying between age x and x+1 |
| Probability of Death | q_x | Probability of dying within one year |
| Probability of Survival | p_x | Probability of surviving one year (p_x = 1 - q_x) |
| Life Expectancy | e_x | Average years of life remaining at age x |

### 2.4.2 Construction of Mortality Tables

Mortality tables are constructed using historical death data from large populations over extended periods.

**Construction Steps:**

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- Gather death records from large population samples
- Collect data over multiple years for accuracy
- Sources: National statistics, insurance company experience, census data

**Step 2: Calculate Death Rates**
- For each age, calculate: Death rate = (Deaths at age x) / (Population at age x)
- Adjust for factors like gender, smoking status, occupation

**Step 3: Smooth the Data**
- Apply mathematical techniques to eliminate random fluctuations
- Ensure logical progression (death rates generally increase with age)

**Step 4: Create Cohort**
- Start with hypothetical group (radix), typically 100,000 lives at age 0
- Apply death rates year by year to calculate survivors

**Step 5: Calculate Probabilities**
- Determine q_x (probability of death) for each age
- Calculate p_x (probability of survival) = 1 - q_x

**Step 6: Validation and Testing**
- Test against actual experience
- Update periodically as mortality improves

### 2.4.3 Sample Mortality Table (Simplified)

**Hypothetical Mortality Table (Extract):**

| **Age (x)** | **Number Living (l_x)** | **Number Dying (d_x)** | **Probability of Death (q_x)** | **Life Expectancy (e_x)** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0 | 100,000 | 800 | 0.00800 | 75.0 |
| 20 | 98,500 | 150 | 0.00152 | 56.5 |
| 30 | 97,800 | 180 | 0.00184 | 47.2 |
| 40 | 96,500 | 250 | 0.00259 | 38.0 |
| 50 | 94,000 | 450 | 0.00479 | 29.5 |
| 60 | 89,500 | 950 | 0.01062 | 21.8 |
| 70 | 78,000 | 2,200 |0.02821 | 14.5 |
| 80 | 52,000 | 4,800 | 0.09231 | 8.9 |
| 90 | 18,000 | 5,400 | 0.30000 | 4.2 |
| 100 | 1,500 | 800 | 0.53333 | 1.8 |

### 2.4.4 Reading and Interpreting a Mortality Table

**Example Interpretations:**

**Age 30 Row:**
- **l_30 = 97,800:** Of the original 100,000 lives, 97,800 survive to age 30
- **d_30 = 180:** Of those alive at age 30, 180 will die before age 31
- **q_30 = 0.00184:** A 30-year-old has a 0.184% chance of dying within one year
- **p_30 = 1 - 0.00184 = 0.99816:** A 30-year-old has 99.816% chance of surviving one year
- **e_30 = 47.2:** A 30-year-old can expect to live another 47.2 years on average (to age 77.2)

**Age 70 Row:**
- **l_70 = 78,000:** Of the original 100,000, 78,000 survive to age 70
- **q_70 = 0.02821:** A 70-year-old has 2.821% chance of dying within one year
- **e_70 = 14.5:** A 70-year-old can expect to live another 14.5 years (to age 84.5)

**Key Observations:**

1. **Mortality Increases with Age:** q_x generally increases as age increases
   - Age 30: 0.184% chance of death
   - Age 70: 2.821% chance of death (15 times higher)
   - Age 90: 30% chance of death (163 times higher than age 30)

2. **Survivors Decrease:** l_x continuously decreases
   - 100,000 at birth
   - 97,800 at age 30
   - 78,000 at age 70
   - 18,000 at age 90

3. **Life Expectancy Decreases with Age:** But not by exactly one year per year
   - Age 30: 47.2 years remaining
   - Age 40: 38.0 years remaining (10 years later, but only 9.2 years less expectancy)
   - This is because many with shorter life expectancy have already died

### 2.4.5 Use of Mortality Tables in Insurance

#### **A. Premium Calculation**

Mortality tables determine the probability of death, which directly affects premium rates.

**Basic Logic:**

Higher probability of death → Higher expected claims → Higher premiums

**Example:**

*$100,000 One-Year Term Insurance (ignoring expenses and interest):*

**Age 30:**
- Probability of death (q_30) = 0.00184
- Expected claim = $100,000 × 0.00184 = $184
- Pure premium needed = **$184**

**Age 70:**
- Probability of death (q_70) = 0.02821
- Expected claim = $100,000 × 0.02821 = $2,821
- Pure premium needed = **$2,821**

**Result:** Premium for age 70 is 15 times higher than age 30 due to mortality differences.

#### **B. Probability of Survival Calculations**

**Question:** What is the probability that a 30-year-old will survive to age 60?

**Calculation:**
- Number alive at age 30 (l_30) = 97,800
- Number alive at age 60 (l_60) = 89,500
- Probability = l_60 / l_30 = 89,500 / 97,800 = **0.9151 or 91.51%**

**Application:** This probability is used to calculate premiums for endowment policies and annuities.

#### **C. Annuity Valuation**

Mortality tables determine how long annuity payments will likely continue.

**Question:** For a $1,000 monthly annuity purchased at age 65, how many payments will the insurer likely make?

**Calculation:**
- Life expectancy at age 65 (e_65) ≈ 18 years (from table)
- Expected number of payments = 18 years × 12 months = **216 payments**
- Expected total payout = 216 × $1,000 = **$216,000**

This helps the insurer price the annuity appropriately. If selling for $180,000, the insurer must earn enough investment return to cover the additional $36,000 plus expenses and profit.

#### **D. Reserve Calculations**

Mortality tables help calculate how much insurers must hold in reserve to meet future obligations.

**Example:** For 1,000 policies of $100,000 each issued to 40-year-olds:
- Number expected to die before age 41: 1,000 × q_40 = 1,000 × 0.00259 = **2.59 deaths**
- Expected claims next year: 2.59 × $100,000 = **$259,000**
- Insurer must hold reserves to pay these expected claims

### 2.4.6 Types of Mortality Tables

#### **Select vs. Ultimate Tables**

**Select Tables:**
- Reflect lower mortality immediately after underwriting
- People just approved for insurance are healthier (medical selection)
- Used for first few policy years

**Ultimate Tables:**
- Reflect normal population mortality
- Selection effect wears off after 5-15 years
- Used for later policy years

**Example:**
- A 40-year-old newly insured (select) might have q_40 = 0.00200
- A 40-year-old insured for 10 years (ultimate) might have q_40 = 0.00259
- Select mortality is lower due to recent medical screening

#### **Population-Specific Tables**

Different tables for different populations:

**By Gender:**
- Women typically live longer than men
- Female tables show lower mortality at each age
- Results in lower premiums for women (where permitted)

**Example:** At age 40:
- Male q_40 = 0.00280
- Female q_40 = 0.00190
- Female premium approximately 32% lower

**By Smoking Status:**
- Smokers have significantly higher mortality
- Separate tables for smokers and non-smokers
- Can double premiums

**By Occupation:**
- Hazardous occupations have higher mortality
- May use special tables or rating factors

**By Health Class:**
- Preferred (excellent health)
- Standard (normal health)
- Substandard (impaired health)

### 2.4.7 Modern Developments

**Mortality Improvement:**
- Life expectancy increasing over time
- Modern tables show lower mortality than older tables
- Insurers must update tables periodically

**Example:** 
- 1980 table: Life expectancy at birth = 70 years
- 2000 table: Life expectancy at birth = 75 years
- 2020 table: Life expectancy at birth = 78 years

**Impact:** Existing annuities become more expensive (people live longer); life insurance becomes less expensive (people die later).

**COVID-19 Impact:**
Recent tables may reflect increased mortality from pandemic, though long-term effects still being assessed.

## 2.5 Claims and Settlement

The **claims process** is the critical moment when the insurance contract fulfills its purpose. Understanding this process is essential for both insurance professionals and consumers.

### 2.5.1 Types of Claims

#### **A. Death Claims**

Most common claim type; paid when the insured dies.

**Requirements:**
- Valid policy in force
- Death during policy term (or any time for whole life)
- Proper documentation submitted

**Documentation Typically Required:**

1. **Claim Form:** Completed by beneficiary
2. **Death Certificate:** Official government-issued certificate
3. **Original Policy Document:** Physical policy
4. **Proof of Age:** If not previously verified
5. **Identity Proof:** Beneficiary's identification
6. **Claimant's Statement:** Details about death circumstances
7. **Medical Attendant's Certificate:** Doctor's report on cause of death
8. **Legal Heir Certificate:** If no nominee or nominee deceased
9. **Police Report:** If death due to accident, suicide, or unnatural causes
10. **Post-Mortem Report:** If required by circumstances

**Special Cases:**

**Accidental Death:**
- Requires police investigation report
- Accident report (if vehicle involved)
- Post-mortem report
- May pay double benefit if "accidental death benefit rider" attached

**Suicide:**
- Police inquest report required
- Post-mortem report
- If within exclusion period (typically 1-2 years): Only premiums returned
- If after exclusion period: Full sum assured paid

**Homicide:**
- Extensive investigation required
- Beneficiary cannot benefit from their own crime
- If beneficiary murdered insured: Claim denied to that beneficiary, may pay alternative beneficiaries or estate

**Example - Straightforward Death Claim:**

*Mr. Hasan (age 55) dies of heart attack. He held $200,000 whole life policy for 15 years.*

**Process:**
1. Widow (beneficiary) notifies insurance company
2. Receives claim forms from insurer
3. Submits: Claim form, death certificate, policy document, ID proof, medical certificate
4. Insurer verifies documentation
5. Checks for fraud, policy status, premium payment status
6. No issues found
7. Claim approved and paid within 30 days: **$200,000**

#### **B. Maturity Claims**

Applies to endowment and money-back policies when the policy term ends.

**Requirements:**
- Policy term completed
- All premiums paid
- Policy not surrendered or lapsed

**Documentation:**

1. **Discharge Form:** Signed by policyholder
2. **Original Policy Document:** Must be surrendered
3. **Identity Proof:** Policyholder identification
4. **Bank Details:** For direct payment

**Payout Includes:**
- Basic sum assured
- Accumulated bonuses (reversionary bonuses)
- Terminal bonus (if declared)
- Less: Any outstanding policy loans

**Example - Maturity Claim:**

*Ms. Akter purchased $50,000 endowment policy, 20-year term, in 2004. Policy matures in 2024.*

**Maturity Benefit Calculation:**

- Basic Sum Assured: $50,000
- Reversionary Bonuses (20 years @ $1,200/year): $24,000
- Terminal Bonus: $8,000
- Outstanding Policy Loan: -$5,000
- **Net Maturity Benefit: $77,000**

**Process:**
1. Insurer notifies policyholder before maturity (typically 3 months)
2. Policyholder submits discharge form and policy document
3. Insurer calculates final benefit including bonuses
4. Payment made on maturity date
5. Check issued or bank transfer: **$77,000**

#### **C. Survival Benefit Claims**

Applies to money-back policies for periodic payments during policy term.

**Process:**
- Simpler than maturity claims
- Insurer typically pays automatically
- May require discharge form
- Policy continues after payment

**Example:**

*$100,000 money-back policy with 20% payouts every 5 years.*

- Year 5: $20,000 paid (policy continues)
- Year 10: $20,000 paid (policy continues)
- Year 15: $20,000 paid (policy continues)
- Year 20: $40,000 + bonuses paid (policy ends)

#### **D. Surrender Claims**

When policyholder voluntarily terminates policy before maturity.

**Surrender Value:**
- Only available after minimum period (typically 3 years)
- Less than total premiums paid
- Reduced for early surrender
- No surrender value in pure term insurance

**Types of Surrender Value:**

**Guaranteed Surrender Value:**
- Minimum value guaranteed by policy
- Typically percentage of premiums paid (e.g., 30% after 3 years, increasing with duration)

**Special Surrender Value:**
- Calculated based on company's financial experience
- Usually higher than guaranteed value
- Varies by company performance

**Example:**

*Mr. Rahman has whole life policy, annual premium $2,000, paid for 7 years. He surrenders the policy.*

**Calculation:**
- Total Premiums Paid: $2,000 × 7 = $14,000
- Guaranteed Surrender Value (40% of premiums): $14,000 × 40% = $5,600
- Special Surrender Value (higher): $7,200
- **Surrender Benefit: $7,200** (higher of the two)

**Important:** Surrendering early results in significant loss. Better alternatives:
- Policy loan (borrow against cash value)
- Reduced paid-up policy (lower coverage, no more premiums)
- Extended term insurance (term coverage for original sum assured)

### 2.5.2 Claims Settlement Process

**Standard Timeline:**

| **Stage** | **Timeframe** | **Activity** |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Claim Intimation | Day 0 | Beneficiary notifies insurer |
| Document Submission | Within 30 days | Submit all required documents |
| Initial Verification | 7-15 days | Insurer verifies basic requirements |
| Investigation (if needed) | 30-90 days | Detailed investigation for suspicious cases |
| Claim Decision | Within 30 days | Approve or deny claim |
| Payment | 7-15 days after approval | Transfer funds to beneficiary |

**Total Timeline (Normal Cases):** 30-60 days  
**Complex Cases:** 90-180 days or longer

### 2.5.3 Reasons for Claim Delays or Denials

**Common Reasons for Delay:**

1. **Incomplete Documentation:** Missing documents or forms
2. **Unclear Death Circumstances:** Requires investigation
3. **Recent Policy:** Issued shortly before death (fraud concern)
4. **Non-Payment of Premiums:** Policy lapsed or in grace period
5. **Nomination Issues:** Unclear or disputed beneficiary
6. **Need for Investigation:** Suspicious circumstances

**Common Reasons for Denial:**

1. **Material Misrepresentation:** False information on application
   - *Example:* Concealed pre-existing disease
   
2. **Suicide Within Exclusion Period:** Death by suicide in first 1-2 years

3. **Death Due to Excluded Cause:** War, criminal activity, excluded hazards

4. **Policy Lapsed:** Premiums not paid, grace period expired

5. **Fraud:** Deliberate deception
   - *Example:* Falsifying death certificate

6. **Breach of Contract:** Violation of policy terms
   - *Example:* Engaging in excluded activities

**Claim Denial Example:**

*Mr. Karim applied for $300,000 life insurance stating he was a non-smoker. He dies of lung cancer after 18 months. Investigation reveals he was a heavy smoker for 20 years.*

**Outcome:**
- Material misrepresentation discovered
- Within contestability period (first 2 years)
- Claim denied or reduced
- **Option 1:** Claim completely denied; premiums returned
- **Option 2:** Benefit adjusted to what premiums would have purchased at smoker rates (e.g., $180,000 instead of $300,000)

### 2.5.4 Claim Dispute Resolution

If claim is denied or disputed:

**Step 1: Internal Review**
- Request reconsideration from insurance company
- Provide additional documentation
- Explain circumstances

**Step 2: Regulatory Complaint**
- File complaint with insurance regulatory authority
- Regulator may mediate or investigate

**Step 3: Ombudsman**
- Independent insurance ombudsman can hear complaints
- Free service for policyholders
- Can award compensation up to certain limits

**Step 4: Legal Action**
- File lawsuit in appropriate court
- More expensive and time-consuming
- May be necessary for large disputed amounts

**Best Practices for Smooth Claims:**

**For Policyholders:**
- ✓ Disclose all material facts accurately at application
- ✓ Keep policy document safe
- ✓ Pay premiums on time
- ✓ Update nominee/beneficiary as needed
- ✓ Inform family about policy existence and location
- ✓ Keep insurer informed of address changes

**For Beneficiaries:**
- ✓ Notify insurer promptly after death
- ✓ Gather all required documents before submitting
- ✓ Provide complete and accurate information
- ✓ Respond quickly to insurer's requests
- ✓ Follow up regularly on claim status

## 2.6 Premium Plans

A **premium** is the amount paid by the policyholder to the insurer in exchange for insurance coverage. Understanding how premiums are structured is crucial to understanding life insurance economics.

### 2.6.1 Natural Premium vs. Level Premium

#### **A. Natural Premium (Yearly Renewable Term Premium)**

**Definition:** Premium that increases each year based on the insured's increasing age and mortality risk.

**Characteristics:**
- Reflects actual mortality cost each year
- Starts very low
- Increases annually
- Becomes prohibitively expensive at older ages
- Matches current risk

**Logic:** As you age, probability of death increases, so premium increases proportionally.

**Example - Natural Premium Progression:**

*$100,000 Term Insurance (Annual Natural Premium):*

| **Age** | **Mortality Rate (q_x)** | **Natural Premium** | **Cumulative Premiums** |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 30 | 0.00184 | $184 | $184 |
| 40 | 0.00259 | $259 | $2,378 |
| 50 | 0.00479 | $479 | $6,128 |
| 60 | 0.01062 | $1,062 | $13,228 |
| 70 | 0.02821 | $2,821 | $30,478 |
| 80 | 0.09231 | $9,231 | $86,273 |

**Note:** Figures simplified; actual premiums include expenses and profit margins.

**Observations:**

1. **Affordable Initially:** $184 at age 30 is very manageable
2. **Steep Increases:** By age 80, premium is 50 times higher ($9,231 vs. $184)
3. **Unsustainable:** Most people cannot afford premiums at advanced ages
4. **Anti-Selection Risk:** Only unhealthy people continue coverage at high ages, increasing costs further

**Problems with Natural Premium:**

- ✗ Unaffordable in old age when coverage most needed
- ✗ Many policyholders drop coverage due to cost
- ✗ Budgeting difficulty (constantly changing premium)
- ✗ Anti-selection (healthy people drop out, unhealthy remain)

**Where Used:**
- Pure one-year term insurance
- Reinsurance contracts
- Some group insurance policies

#### **B. Level Premium**

**Definition:** Premium that remains constant throughout the policy period, calculated as an average of natural premiums over the policy's lifetime.

**Characteristics:**
- Fixed amount each year
- Overpayment in early years
- Underpayment in later years
- Excess creates reserve/cash value
- Sustainable long-term

**Logic:** 
- Early years: Pay MORE than natural premium → Excess accumulates as reserve
- Later years: Pay LESS than natural premium → Reserve covers the deficit
- Over lifetime: Total level premiums = Total natural premiums + interest earned on reserves

**Example - Level Premium vs. Natural Premium:**

*$100,000 Whole Life Insurance (simplified illustration):*

| **Age** | **Natural Premium** | **Level Premium** | **Overpayment/(Underpayment)** | **Reserve Accumulation** |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 30 | $184 | $1,500 | $1,316 | $1,316 |
| 35 | $220 | $1,500 | $1,280 | $7,896 |
| 40 | $259 | $1,500 | $1,241 | $15,180 |
| 50 | $479 | $1,500 | $1,021 | $31,895 |
| 60 | $1,062 | $1,500 | $438 | $48,650 |
| 70 | $2,821 | $1,500 | ($1,321) | $52,240 |
| 80 | $9,231 | $1,500 | ($7,731) | $28,150 |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Ages 30-60:** Level premium ($1,500) exceeds natural premium → Building reserves
2. **Ages 70+:** Natural premium exceeds level premium → Reserves finance the gap
3. **Reserve Peak:** Typically around retirement age (60-65)
4. **Death Benefit Source:** Reserve + remaining premiums of other policyholders

**Advantages of Level Premium:**

- ✓ Predictable budgeting (same amount every year)
- ✓ Affordable at older ages
- ✓ Encourages long-term retention
- ✓ Creates cash value (savings component)
- ✓ Can borrow against cash value
- ✓ Ensures lifelong coverage affordability

**Disadvantages:**

- ✗ Higher initial cost than natural premium
- ✗ Overpayment in early years (opportunity cost)
- ✗ Complex to calculate
- ✗ Significant loss if surrendered early

**Where Used:**
- Whole life insurance
- Endowment policies
- Long-term term insurance (10, 20, 30-year terms)
- Universal life insurance

### 2.6.2 Premium Payment Methods

#### **A. By Frequency:**

**1. Annual Premium:**
- Paid once per year
- Most economical (lowest total cost)
- Requires large lump sum

**2. Semi-Annual Premium:**
- Paid twice per year
- Approximately 51% of annual premium each time
- Total slightly more than annual mode

**3. Quarterly Premium:**
- Paid four times per year
- Approximately 26% of annual premium each time
- More expensive than semi-annual

**4. Monthly Premium:**
- Paid twelve times per year
- Approximately 9% of annual premium each time
- Most expensive but easiest to budget
- Most popular for affordability

**Cost Comparison Example:**

*Annual Premium = $1,200*

| **Payment Mode** | **Amount per Payment** | **Annual Total** | **Extra Cost vs. Annual** |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Annual | $1,200 | $1,200 | $0 (0%) |
| Semi-Annual | $612 | $1,224 | $24 (2%) |
| Quarterly | $312 | $1,248 | $48 (4%) |
| Monthly | $104 | $1,248 | $48 (4%) |

**Reason for Higher Cost:** More frequent payments create administrative burden and reduce investment income (money received later).

#### **B. By Payment Duration:**

**Regular Premium Policies:**
- Premiums paid throughout policy term
- Most common structure

**Limited Payment Policies:**
- Premiums paid for limited period only
- Higher annual premium but policy becomes "paid-up"
- Examples: 10-pay, 20-pay, paid-up at 65

**Single Premium Policies:**
- Entire premium paid at inception
- Immediate full coverage
- Highest upfront cost but no future payments
- Immediate cash value

### 2.6.3 Premium Components

Every premium consists of multiple elements:

**Total Premium = Net Premium + Loading**

**Net Premium:**
- Pure cost of insurance (mortality cost)
- Based on mortality tables
- Covers expected death claims only

**Loading:**
- Expenses
- Commission to agents
- Administrative costs
- Profit margin
- Contingency reserves

**Typical Breakdown (illustrative):**

| **Component** | **Percentage of Total Premium** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Mortality Cost (Net Premium) | 50-60% |
| Acquisition Expenses (Commission) | 15-25% |
| Administrative Expenses | 10-15% |
| Profit & Contingency | 5-10% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

**Example:**

*Annual Premium = $1,000*

- Net Premium (mortality): $600
- Commission (first year high): $200
- Administrative expenses: $120
- Profit and reserves: $80

**Note:** Commission typically higher in first year, lower in renewal years.

---

## 2.7 Computation of Net Premium

The **net premium** is the pure cost of providing insurance coverage, excluding expenses and profit. It is calculated using actuarial mathematics, mortality tables, and interest assumptions.

### 2.7.1 Basic Principles

**Net Premium Must Cover:**
1. Expected death claims
2. Reduced by interest earned on reserves

**Key Factors in Calculation:**

1. **Mortality:** Probability of death at each age (from mortality tables)
2. **Interest:** Investment return on premiums collected (assumed rate)
3. **Time:** When premiums paid and claims occur
4. **Policy Type:** Term, whole life, or endowment

### 2.7.2 Present Value Concept

**Present Value (PV):** The current worth of a future amount, discounted for interest.

**Formula:**
```
PV = Future Value / (1 + i)^n
```

Where:
- i = interest rate
- n = number of years

**Example:**

*What is the present value of $10,000 receivable in 10 years, assuming 5% interest?*

```
PV = $10,000 / (1.05)^10
PV = $10,000 / 1.629
PV = $6,139
```

**Interpretation:** $6,139 today, invested at 5%, will grow to $10,000 in 10 years.

### 2.7.3 Net Single Premium (One-Time Payment)

The **Net Single Premium (NSP)** is the lump sum needed today to fund all future benefits, considering mortality and interest.

#### **Formula for One-Year Term Insurance:**

```
NSP = (Sum Assured × Probability of Death) / (1 + i)
```

**Example - One-Year Term:**

*$100,000 one-year term insurance for age 40, assuming:*
- q_40 (probability of death) = 0.00259
- Interest rate = 5%

```
Expected Claim = $100,000 × 0.00259 = $259

NSP = $259 / (1 + 0.05)
NSP = $259 / 1.05
NSP = $246.67
```

**Interpretation:** $246.67 today, invested at 5%, will provide sufficient funds to pay expected claims ($259) one year from now.

#### **Formula for n-Year Term Insurance:**

For multi-year term insurance, calculate present value of expected claim each year:

```
NSP = Σ [Sum Assured × (Probability of survival to year k) × (Probability of death in year k)] / (1 + i)^k
```

**Example - 3-Year Term Insurance:**

*$100,000 term insurance, age 40, 3-year term:*

**Given Data:**
- q_40 = 0.00259
- q_41 = 0.00275
- q_42 = 0.00293
- Interest = 5%

**Year 1 Expected Claim:**
```
Probability of death in Year 1 = q_40 = 0.00259
Expected claim = $100,000 × 0.00259 = $259
PV = $259 / 1.05 = $246.67
```

**Year 2 Expected Claim:**
```
Probability of surviving Year 1 = 1 - q_40 = 0.99741
Probability of dying in Year 2 (given survival to Year 2) = q_41 = 0.00275
Combined probability = 0.99741 × 0.00275 = 0.002743
Expected claim = $100,000 × 0.002743 = $274.30
PV = $274.30 / (1.05)^2 = $274.30 / 1.1025 = $248.78
```

**Year 3 Expected Claim:**
```
Probability of surviving to Year 3 = 0.99741 × (1 - 0.00275) = 0.99467
Probability of dying in Year 3 = q_42 = 0.00293
Combined probability = 0.99467 × 0.00293 = 0.002914
Expected claim = $100,000 × 0.002914 = $291.40
PV = $291.40 / (1.05)^3 = $291.40 / 1.1576 = $251.72
```

**Net Single Premium (3-year term):**
```
NSP = $246.67 + $248.78 + $251.72 = $747.17
```

**Interpretation:** A single payment of $747.17 today will fund expected claims over 3 years, considering mortality and 5% investment return.

#### **Whole Life Insurance Net Single Premium:**

For whole life, sum all years from current age to maximum age (typically 100 or 120):

```
NSP = Σ [Sum Assured × (Survival probability to year k) × (Death probability in year k)] / (1 + i)^k
```

Summed from k=1 to terminal age.

**Practical Note:** Actual calculations use actuarial notation and commutation functions for efficiency. The principles remain the same.

#### **Endowment Insurance Net Single Premium:**

Endowment pays on death OR survival, so NSP includes both components:

```
NSP = (Present Value of Death Benefits) + (Present Value of Survival Benefit)
```

**Example - Simplified:**

*$50,000 Endowment, 20-year term, age 40:*

**Death Benefit Component:**
Sum of discounted death claims for years 1-20 (calculated as above) = $8,500

**Survival Benefit Component:**
```
Probability of surviving 20 years = 0.95 (from mortality table)
Survival benefit = $50,000
PV = ($50,000 × 0.95) / (1.05)^20
PV = $47,500 / 2.653
PV = $17,904
```

**Total NSP:**
```
NSP = $8,500 + $17,904 = $26,404
```

**Interpretation:** $26,404 paid today will fund both death benefits (if death occurs within 20 years) and maturity benefit (if survives 20 years).

### 2.7.4 Net Level Premium (Annual Premium)

Most policies use **level premiums** paid annually (or more frequently). The Net Level Premium is calculated so that the present value of all premiums equals the net single premium.

**Formula:**

```
Net Level Premium = Net Single Premium / Present Value of Annuity
```

**Present Value of Annuity:** The present value of $1 paid at the beginning of each year for the premium payment period, adjusted for survival probability.

**Example - Whole Life:**

*$100,000 Whole Life, Age 40, Net Single Premium = $15,000:*

**Step 1: Calculate Present Value of Life Annuity Due**

Assuming present value of life annuity due (paying $1 annually for life starting age 40) = 16.5

**Step 2: Calculate Net Level Premium**

```
Net Level Premium = NSP / PV of Annuity Due
Net Level Premium = $15,000 / 16.5
Net Level Premium = $909 per year
```

**Interpretation:** Paying $909 annually for life has the same present value as paying $15,000 once today.

**Example - 20-Year Endowment:**

*$50,000 Endowment, Age 40, Net Single Premium = $26,404:*

Assuming PV of 20-year annuity due = 13.5

```
Net Level Premium = $26,404 / 13.5
Net Level Premium = $1,956 per year
```

**Interpretation:** 20 annual payments of $1,956 each will fund the endowment, considering mortality and interest.

### 2.7.5 Gross Premium (Commercial Premium)

The **Gross Premium** is what policyholders actually pay. It includes net premium plus loading for expenses and profit.

**Formula:**

```
Gross Premium = Net Premium + Loading
```

or

```
Gross Premium = Net Premium / (1 - Expense Ratio)
```

**Example:**

*Net Premium = $1,956, Expense Ratio = 25%*

```
Gross Premium = $1,956/ (1 - 0.25)
Gross Premium = $1,956 / 0.75
Gross Premium = $2,608
```

**Breakdown:**
- Net Premium (mortality cost): $1,956 (75%)
- Loading (expenses, commission, profit): $652 (25%)
- **Total Gross Premium: $2,608**

## 2.8 Calculation of Reserve, Surplus, and Distribution

### 2.8.1 What is a Reserve?

**Reserve** (also called Policy Reserve or Mathematical Reserve) is the amount an insurer must hold to meet future policy obligations. It represents the excess of premiums paid over claims paid, accumulated with interest.

**Why Reserves Are Necessary:**

Remember that level premiums are structured so policyholders overpay in early years and underpay in later years. The overpayment creates a reserve that finances later underpayments.

**Legal Requirement:**
Insurance regulators require companies to maintain adequate reserves to ensure solvency and ability to pay claims.

**Reserve = Liability to Policyholders**

From the insurer's perspective, reserves are a liability—money owed to policyholders in the future.

### 2.8.2 Calculating Reserves

**Prospective Method (Most Common):**

Reserve = (Present Value of Future Benefits) - (Present Value of Future Premiums)

**Logic:** The reserve is the difference between what the insurer must pay out in the future and what it will receive in premiums.

**Retrospective Method:**

Reserve = (Accumulated Past Premiums with Interest) - (Accumulated Past Claims)

**Logic:** The reserve is the accumulation of past overpayments.

**Example - Prospective Method:**

*After 10 years of a $100,000 Whole Life policy issued at age 30 (now age 40):*

**Step 1: Calculate Present Value of Future Death Benefits**

At age 40, assuming Net Single Premium for $100,000 whole life = $15,000

**Step 2: Calculate Present Value of Future Premiums**

Annual Net Premium = $909 (from earlier example)
PV of Life Annuity Due at age 40 = 16.5

```
PV of Future Premiums = $909 × 16.5 = $14,999
```

**Step 3: Calculate Reserve**

```
Reserve = PV of Future Benefits - PV of Future Premiums
Reserve = $15,000 - $14,999
Reserve = $1
```

**Wait, that seems wrong!** This is because at age 30, the premium was calculated assuming issue age 30. Let's recalculate properly:

**Corrected Example:**

*$100,000 Whole Life, issued at age 30, Annual Net Premium = $600, Now age 40 (after 10 years):*

**At Age 40:**
- Net Single Premium for $100,000 whole life at age 40 = $15,000
- Remaining annual premium = $600
- PV of Life Annuity Due at age 40 = 16.5
- PV of Future Premiums = $600 × 16.5 = $9,900

```
Reserve at Age 40 = $15,000 - $9,900 = $5,100
```

**Interpretation:** The insurer must hold $5,100 per policy to ensure it can pay future claims, given future premiums to be received.

**Reserve Growth Over Time:**

| **Age** | **Policy Year** | **Reserve per $100,000** |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 30 | 0 (issue) | $0 |
| 35 | 5 | $2,500 |
| 40 | 10 | $5,100 |
| 50 | 20 | $12,800 |
| 60 | 30 | $24,500 |
| 70 | 40 | $42,000 |
| 80 | 50 | $68,000 |
| 90 | 60 | $88,000 |

**Observations:**

1. Reserve starts at $0 (at policy issue)
2. Grows over time as overpayments accumulate
3. Approaches sum assured as age increases (approaching certain death)
4. At age 100+, reserve equals sum assured (death is imminent)

### 2.8.3 Relationship Between Cash Value and Reserve

**Cash Value** = Reserve - Surrender Charge

**Surrender Charge:** Deduction to recover insurer's acquisition expenses if policy terminated early.

Typically:
- Years 1-3: High surrender charges (50-70% of reserve)
- Years 4-7: Moderate charges (20-40% of reserve)
- Years 8+: Low or no charges (0-10% of reserve)

**Example:**

*Reserve after 5 years = $2,500*
*Surrender charge = 30% of reserve = $750*
*Cash Surrender Value = $2,500 - $750 = $1,750*

### 2.8.4 What is Surplus?

**Surplus** is the excess of actual experience over assumed experience. It arises when actual results are better than what was assumed in premium calculations.

**Sources of Surplus:**

**1. Mortality Surplus:**
- Occurs when actual deaths are fewer than expected
- Source: Healthier policyholders than assumed

**Example:**
- Expected deaths (based on mortality table): 25 per 10,000 policies
- Actual deaths: 20 per 10,000 policies
- Mortality surplus: 5 fewer claims than expected

**2. Interest/Investment Surplus:**
- Occurs when actual investment returns exceed assumed rate
- Source: Better investment performance

**Example:**
- Assumed interest rate in calculations: 5%
- Actual earned interest: 7%
- Interest surplus: 2% extra return

**3. Expense Surplus:**
- Occurs when actual expenses are lower than loading included in premium
- Source: Operational efficiency, economies of scale

**Example:**
- Expense loading in premium: 20%
- Actual expenses: 16%
- Expense surplus: 4% of premium

**4. Lapse Surplus:**
- Occurs when policies lapse (policyholders stop paying)
- Source: Forfeited reserves from surrendered policies

### 2.8.5 Distribution of Surplus (Bonus/Dividends)

In **participating (with-profits) policies**, surplus is shared with policyholders in the form of bonuses or dividends.

**Non-Participating (without-profits) policies:** No surplus distribution; premiums typically lower.

**Methods of Bonus Distribution:**

#### **A. Reversionary Bonus (Simple Bonus)**

- Declared annually or periodically
- Added to sum assured
- Becomes part of guaranteed benefit
- Once declared, cannot be taken back
- Expressed as amount per $1,000 sum assured

**Example:**

*$100,000 Whole Life Policy, Annual Bonus = $30 per $1,000:*

**Year 1:** Bonus = ($100,000 / $1,000) × $30 = $3,000  
**Cumulative Sum Assured = $103,000**

**Year 2:** Bonus = ($100,000 / $1,000) × $30 = $3,000  
**Cumulative Sum Assured = $106,000**

**Year 10:** Cumulative Bonus = $3,000 × 10 = $30,000  
**Total Sum Assured = $130,000**

**Note:** Simple reversionary bonus is calculated on original sum assured, not the increased amount.

#### **B. Compound Reversionary Bonus**

- Each year's bonus calculated on sum assured plus accumulated bonuses
- Grows faster than simple bonus
- More common in modern policies

**Example:**

*$100,000 Policy, Annual Bonus = $30 per $1,000:*

**Year 1:** 
- Bonus = ($100,000 / $1,000) × $30 = $3,000
- New Sum Assured = $103,000

**Year 2:**
- Bonus = ($103,000 / $1,000) × $30 = $3,090
- New Sum Assured = $106,090

**Year 10:** Accumulated through compounding = $34,500 (vs. $30,000 simple)  
**Total Sum Assured = $134,500**

#### **C. Cash Bonus**

- Paid in cash to policyholder
- Can be used for any purpose
- Does not increase sum assured
- Taxable in many jurisdictions
- Rare in life insurance (more common in general insurance)

#### **D. Terminal Bonus (Final Bonus)**

- Paid at policy maturity, death, or surrender (after minimum period)
- Large one-time payment
- Rewards long-term persistency
- Smooths investment returns
- Not guaranteed until paid

**Example - Endowment Maturity:**

*$50,000 Endowment, 20-year term:*

- Basic Sum Assured: $50,000
- Accumulated Reversionary Bonuses: $24,000
- Terminal Bonus: $12,000
- **Total Maturity Benefit: $86,000**

Terminal bonus rewards the policyholder for maintaining the policy for the full term.

#### **E. Bonus Options**

Some insurers offer policyholders choices for using bonuses:

**1. Accumulate (Default):**
- Bonuses added to sum assured
- Increases death/maturity benefit

**2. Cash Payment:**
- Receive bonus in cash
- Reduces long-term benefit

**3. Premium Reduction:**
- Use bonus to reduce future premiums
- Maintains original sum assured

**4. Paid-Up Additions:**
- Purchase additional paid-up insurance
- No further premiums on bonus amount

### 2.8.6 Factors Affecting Bonus Rates

**Investment Performance:**
- Strong returns → Higher bonuses
- Poor returns → Lower bonuses

**Mortality Experience:**
- Fewer deaths than expected → Higher bonuses
- More deaths → Lower bonuses

**Expense Management:**
- Lower expenses → Higher bonuses
- High expenses → Lower bonuses

**Policy Persistency:**
- Low lapse rates → More stable bonuses
- High lapse rates → Affects bonus sustainability

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Must maintain solvency margins
- Cannot distribute all surplus (must retain reserves)

**Example - Bonus Declaration:**

*ABC Life Insurance Company Year-End Analysis:*

**Surplus Generated:**
- Mortality surplus: $10 million (fewer deaths)
- Interest surplus: $15 million (strong investments)
- Expense surplus: $5 million (efficient operations)
- **Total Surplus: $30 million**

**Surplus Allocation:**
- Retained for solvency: $10 million (33%)
- Shareholders (if applicable): $5 million (17%)
- Policyholders (bonus pool): $15 million (50%)

**Bonus Declaration:**
With $15 million available and $500 million total sum assured on participating policies:
```
Average Bonus Rate = ($15 million / $500 million) × $1,000
Average Bonus Rate = $30 per $1,000 sum assured
```

**Individual Policy Impact:**

*Mr. Hasan's $100,000 policy receives:*
```
Annual Bonus = ($100,000 / $1,000) × $30 = $3,000
```

### 2.8.7 Participating vs. Non-Participating Policies

| **Aspect** | **Participating (With-Profits)** | **Non-Participating (Without-Profits)** |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Premiums** | Higher | Lower |
| **Bonus** | Receive bonuses | No bonuses |
| **Final Benefit** | Potentially higher (with bonuses) | Fixed sum assured only |
| **Certainty** | Less certain (bonuses vary) | Fully certain |
| **Risk** | Shares in company performance | No participation in performance |
| **Popularity** | Traditional policies | Modern term insurance |

**Example Comparison:**

*$100,000 Endowment, 20-year term, both issued at age 30:*

**Participating Policy:**
- Annual Premium: $2,800
- Maturity: $100,000 + $35,000 bonuses = **$135,000**
- Total Premiums Paid: $56,000

**Non-Participating Policy:**
- Annual Premium: $2,200
- Maturity: **$100,000** (fixed)
- Total Premiums Paid: $44,000

**Analysis:**
- Participating pays $12,000 more in premiums
- Receives $35,000 more at maturity
- Net advantage: $23,000 (if bonuses materialize)
- But bonuses not guaranteed; non-participating offers certainty

## Chapter Summary

This chapter explored the comprehensive world of life assurance:

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Life Insurance Contracts** are unique financial instruments that provide protection against premature death or build savings for the future, operating on principles distinct from other insurance types.

2. **Policy Types** serve different needs:
   - **Term Insurance:** Pure protection, affordable, temporary
   - **Whole Life:** Permanent coverage with cash value accumulation
   - **Endowment:** Combines protection with guaranteed savings
   - **Annuities:** Provide income protection against longevity risk

3. **Mortality Tables** are the foundation of life insurance pricing, showing death probabilities at each age and enabling accurate premium calculations and reserve requirements.

4. **Claims Settlement** is the ultimate purpose of insurance, requiring proper documentation and following established procedures for death claims, maturity benefits, and survival benefits.

5. **Premium Structures** can be natural (increasing annually) or level (constant), with level premiums creating cash values through overpayment in early years that finance underpayment in later years.

6. **Net Premium Calculation** uses actuarial mathematics, mortality tables, and interest assumptions to determine the pure cost of insurance coverage before expenses.

7. **Reserves** represent the insurer's liability to policyholders, growing over time as the excess of premiums over claims accumulates with interest.

8. **Surplus and Bonuses** allow participating policyholders to share in the insurer's favorable experience through various bonus mechanisms, enhancing policy benefits beyond the guaranteed amount.

Understanding these concepts provides a solid foundation for appreciating how life insurance operates as both a risk management tool and a savings vehicle, serving crucial roles in financial planning for individuals and families.

## Case Studies for Analysis

### Case Study 1: Policy Selection

**Scenario:**  
Mr. Rahim, age 30, married with two young children (ages 3 and 5), earns $30,000 annually. He has a $150,000 mortgage with 25 years remaining. He can afford $2,000 annually for life insurance but needs sufficient coverage to protect his family.

**Options:**
- **Option A:** $300,000 term insurance (25 years) at $600/year
- **Option B:** $100,000 whole life insurance at $2,000/year
- **Option C:** $75,000 endowment insurance (20 years) at $2,000/year

4. What other factors should Mr. Rahim consider?

### Case Study 2: Claims Dispute

**Scenario:**  
Ms. Sultana purchased a $200,000 life insurance policy 18 months ago at age 45. On her application, she stated she was a non-smoker and had no health issues. She dies in a car accident 18 months later. During the claims investigation, the insurer discovers:
- She was a smoker (20 cigarettes daily for 10 years)
- She had been diagnosed with high blood pressure 3 years ago (taking medication)
- She did not disclose either fact on her application

Her family has filed a claim for the full $200,000 death benefit.

**Questions:**
1. What principles of insurance are relevant to this case?
2. Should the insurer pay the claim? If so, how much?
3. What would be different if the policy had been in force for 3 years instead of 18 months?
4. What arguments could the family make? What arguments could the insurer make?
5. What would be a fair resolution?

### Case Study 3: Premium and Benefit Comparison

**Scenario:**  
Two friends, both age 35, purchase $100,000 life insurance policies:

**Friend A:** Purchases participating whole life insurance
- Annual Premium: $1,800
- Guaranteed sum assured: $100,000
