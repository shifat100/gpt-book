## 3.1 Introduction to Marine Insurance

**Marine Insurance** is the oldest form of insurance, dating back to ancient maritime trade. It provides coverage for ships, cargo, and freight against perils of the sea and other risks associated with marine transportation.

### 3.1.1 Definition and Importance

**Marine Insurance** is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured, in the manner and to the extent agreed, against losses incidental to marine adventure.

**Marine Adventure** exists when:
- Any ship, goods, or other moveable property is exposed to maritime perils
- Earning or acquisition of freight, cargo, or other pecuniary benefit is endangered by such perils
- Any liability to a third party may be incurred by the owner due to maritime perils

### 3.1.2 Subject Matter of Marine Insurance

**Three Primary Categories:**

#### **A. Hull Insurance (Ship/Vessel)**
- Covers the ship or vessel itself
- Includes machinery, equipment, and stores
- Protects shipowner's investment

**Example:** A shipping company insures its cargo vessel worth $20 million against damage from storms, collision, grounding, or fire.

#### **B. Cargo Insurance (Goods)**
- Covers goods being transported by sea
- Protects cargo owner (exporter/importer)
- Most common type of marine insurance

**Example:** A garment manufacturer in Bangladesh insures $500,000 worth of clothing being exported to Europe against loss or damage during the voyage.

#### **C. Freight Insurance**
- Covers the freight charges (shipping costs)
- Protects carrier's revenue from transportation
- Important when freight is payable on delivery

**Example:** A shipping company insures $50,000 in freight charges it expects to earn from delivering cargo. If the ship sinks and cargo is not delivered, the insurer pays the lost freight.

### 3.1.3 Perils of the Sea

**Perils of the sea** are dangers peculiar to marine navigation that are not the inevitable result of ordinary wear and tear.

**Covered Perils Include:**

1. **Fortuitous Accidents:**
   - Storms, tempests, hurricanes
   - Lightning strikes
   - Earthquakes at sea
   - Volcanic eruptions

2. **Collision and Contact:**
   - Ship-to-ship collision
   - Contact with icebergs
   - Striking rocks, reefs, or other objects

3. **Stranding and Grounding:**
   - Ship running aground
   - Getting stuck on sandbanks

4. **Fire and Explosion:**
   - Fire on board
   - Explosion of cargo or fuel

5. **Violent Actions:**
   - Piracy
   - Barratry (crew misconduct)
   - Theft by violence
   - Jettison (throwing cargo overboard to save ship)

6. **Sinking and Capsizing:**
   - Vessel sinking
   - Vessel overturning

**Not Perils of the Sea (Typically Excluded):**
- Ordinary wear and tear
- Gradual deterioration
- Inherent vice (natural characteristics of goods causing damage)
- Ordinary leakage and breakage
- Delay (unless specifically covered)
- Rats and vermin (unless due to maritime peril)

**Important Distinction:**

**Peril OF the Sea** vs. **Peril ON the Sea:**

- **Peril OF the Sea:** Fortuitous accident or casualty (COVERED)
  - *Example:* Ship damaged by unexpected storm

- **Peril ON the Sea:** Ordinary incidents of sea travel (NOT COVERED)
  - *Example:* Cargo damaged by seawater seeping through ordinary wear in hull

### 3.1.4 Historical and Economic Significance

**Global Trade Dependency:**
- Over 90% of world trade transported by sea
- Marine insurance enables international commerce
- Without marine insurance, global trade would be severely limited

**Bangladesh Context:**
- Major exporter of ready-made garments (RMG)
- Exports worth billions depend on marine insurance
- Imports of raw materials, machinery, and consumer goods protected by marine coverage
- Chittagong and Mongla ports handle millions of tons of cargo annually

**Economic Impact:**
- Protects exporters and importers from catastrophic losses
- Facilitates letter of credit transactions (banks require marine insurance)
- Enables businesses to plan with certainty
- Supports employment in shipping, trade, and logistics sectors

## 3.2 The Marine Insurance Contract

### 3.2.1 Definition and Legal Framework

A **marine insurance contract** is an agreement whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured against marine losses in the manner and to the extent agreed upon.

**Legal Framework:**

Most countries' marine insurance law is based on or influenced by the **Marine Insurance Act 1906** (UK), which codified marine insurance principles. Many provisions remain relevant today.

**Key Principle:** Marine insurance is a **contract of indemnity** - the insured should be restored to the same financial position as before the loss, but should not profit from the loss.

### 3.2.2 Essential Features of Marine Insurance Contracts

#### **A. Insurable Interest**

The insured must have an insurable interest in the subject matter at the time of loss.

**Important Difference from Other Insurance:**

In marine insurance, insurable interest:
- **Must exist at the time of loss**
- **Need not exist when policy is effected** (can be insured in expectation)
- **Must exist when claim is made**

This differs from life insurance (interest needed at inception only) and property insurance (interest needed at inception and loss).

**Who Has Insurable Interest in Marine Adventures:**

| **Party** | **Insurable Interest In** | **Extent of Interest** |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Shipowner** | Vessel (hull) | Full value of ship |
| **Cargo Owner** | Goods being shipped | Value of goods + freight prepaid |
| **Freight Carrier** | Freight charges | Amount of freight to be earned |
| **Mortgagee (Lender)** | Mortgaged ship | Amount of outstanding loan |
| **Charterer** | Ship hired | Potential loss from charter agreement |
| **Shipper** | Goods + freight | Cost of goods + shipping charges |
| **Consignee/Buyer** | Goods purchased | Purchase price + freight |

**Example:**

*ABC Company in Bangladesh exports garments to a UK buyer under CIF terms (Cost, Insurance, Freight - seller arranges and pays for shipping and insurance).*

**Insurable Interest:**
- **ABC Company:** Has insurable interest until goods delivered (owns goods, paid freight)
- **UK Buyer:** Has insurable interest upon shipment (has purchased goods)
- **Shipping Company:** Has insurable interest in freight earnings
- **Ship Owner:** Has insurable interest in vessel

**Each party can insure their respective interests.**

**Contingent Interest:**

Sometimes insurable interest is contingent on future events.

**Example:** An agent advances money to ship cargo and has insurable interest in the cargo to the extent of the advance, in case the principal (owner) defaults.

#### **B. Utmost Good Faith (Uberrimae Fidei)**

Marine insurance contracts require the highest degree of good faith from both parties. This principle is even more critical in marine insurance than in other insurance types.

**Why Especially Important in Marine Insurance:**

1. **Information Asymmetry:** The insured knows far more about the ship, cargo, route, and circumstances than the insurer
2. **Geographic Distance:** Risks occur far away, making verification difficult
3. **Complexity:** Maritime risks are complex and varied
4. **Historical Practice:** Marine insurance developed when communication was slow and verification impossible

**Duty of Disclosure:**

The insured must disclose **all material facts** before the contract is made, whether asked or not.

**Material Fact:** Any circumstance that would influence a prudent insurer in:
- Deciding whether to accept the risk
- Determining the premium rate
- Imposing special conditions

**Material Facts in Marine Insurance Include:**

1. **Vessel-Related:**
   - Age and condition of ship
   - Classification society rating
   - Previous casualties or losses
   - Repair history
   - Seaworthiness issues

2. **Cargo-Related:**
   - Nature of goods (hazardous, fragile, valuable)
   - Packaging and stowage methods
   - Previous losses of similar cargo
   - Special vulnerabilities

3. **Voyage-Related:**
   - Proposed route
   - Expected duration
   - Known hazards en route
   - Season and weather expectations
   - Ports of call

4. **Crew and Management:**
   - Captain's experience and record
   - Crew competence
   - Previous misconduct (barratry)

5. **Other Circumstances:**
   - War or piracy in transit area
   - Changes in sailing date
   - Deviation from planned route (if known in advance)

**Example of Material Non-Disclosure:**

*Scenario:* A shipowner seeks hull insurance for a vessel without disclosing that the ship failed its last inspection and was cited for safety violations.

*Outcome:* This is material non-disclosure. If discovered, the insurer can void the policy *ab initio* (from the beginning), and refuse any claim even if unrelated to the safety violations.

**Example of Proper Disclosure:**

*Scenario:* A cargo owner insures electronics shipment and discloses that:
- Goods are high-value ($2 million)
- Previous shipment sustained water damage
- Cargo requires climate-controlled container
- Route includes piracy-risk waters off Somalia

*Outcome:* Insurer assesses the risk accurately, may charge higher premium or impose conditions (armed guards, specific routing), but contract is valid.

**Consequences of Non-Disclosure:**

- Policy voidable at insurer's option
- Claims can be denied entirely
- Premiums not refunded (insurer keeps premium as penalty)
- Applies even to innocent non-disclosure (no intent to deceive required)

#### **C. Principle of Indemnity**

Marine insurance aims to place the insured in the same financial position after a loss as before, but no better.

**Application in Marine Insurance:**

**Measure of Indemnity:**

For different subject matters:

| **Subject Matter** | **Measure of Indemnity** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Ship/Vessel** | Reasonable cost of repairs, or agreed value if total loss |
| **Cargo** | Prime cost (purchase price) + shipping expenses + insurance + reasonable profit margin |
| **Freight** | Freight at risk (amount that would have been earned if voyage completed) |

**Example:**

*Cargo valued at $100,000 (purchase price) insured for $120,000. Cargo totally lost.*

**Indemnity Calculation:**
- Purchase price: $100,000
- Freight prepaid: $8,000
- Insurance premium: $1,200
- Reasonable profit margin (10%): $10,000
- **Maximum Indemnity: $119,200**

Even though insured for $120,000, indemnity limited to actual insurable value plus reasonable expenses.

**Exception - Valued Policies:**

In **valued policies**, the value is agreed in advance and becomes conclusive in case of total loss (discussed in Section 3.3).

#### **D. Subrogation**

After paying a claim, the insurer acquires the insured's rights against third parties responsible for the loss.

**Common Subrogation Scenarios in Marine Insurance:**

1. **Collision:** If another ship causes damage, insurer can sue that ship's owner
2. **Carrier Negligence:** If cargo damaged due to carrier's fault, cargo insurer can sue carrier
3. **Stevedore Damage:** If loading/unloading workers damage cargo, insurer can recover
4. **Salvage:** Insurer entitled to salvaged property after paying total loss claim

**Example:**

*Scenario:* Ship A collides with Ship B due to Ship A's negligence. Ship B suffers $500,000 damage. Ship B's hull insurer pays the claim.

*Subrogation:* Ship B's insurer now has the right to sue Ship A's owner for the $500,000. If recovered, the insurer recoups its payment.

**Limitation:** Insurer cannot subrogate against the insured or parties with whom the insured has waived rights (e.g., through contract terms).

#### **E. Contribution**

If the same interest is insured with multiple insurers, each contributes proportionally to the loss.

**Example:**

*Cargo worth $600,000 insured with three insurers:*
- Insurer A: $300,000
- Insurer B: $200,000
- Insurer C: $100,000
- Total Coverage: $600,000

*Partial loss of $240,000 occurs.*

**Contribution:**
- Insurer A: ($300,000/$600,000) × $240,000 = $120,000
- Insurer B: ($200,000/$600,000) × $240,000 = $80,000
- Insurer C: ($100,000/$600,000) × $240,000 = $40,000
- **Total: $240,000**

#### **F. Proximate Cause**

Only losses proximately caused by an insured peril are covered.

**Marine Insurance Application:**

The proximate cause must be a peril insured against, not an excluded peril.

**Example - Covered:**

*Chain of Events:* Storm (insured peril) → Ship damaged → Takes on water → Cargo damaged by water

*Proximate Cause:* Storm (insured peril)  
*Result:* **Claim COVERED**

**Example - Not Covered:**

*Chain of Events:* Poor maintenance (excluded) → Hull weakens → Normal waves → Water enters → Cargo damaged

*Proximate Cause:* Poor maintenance/inherent vice (excluded, not fortuitous)  
*Result:* **Claim DENIED**

**Example - Complex:**

*Chain of Events:* Storm → Ship seeks refuge in port → War breaks out → Ship detained by authorities → Cargo spoils

*Analysis:* Storm was insured peril, but war detention is typically excluded. Was storm the proximate cause, or was war an independent intervening cause?

*Likely Outcome:* Depends on policy wording and whether war was foreseeable. If war was remote and unforeseeable consequence, storm might be proximate cause (covered). If war was independent event breaking the chain, loss not covered.

## 3.3 Types of Marine Insurance Policies

Marine insurance policies can be classified according to various criteria: duration, valuation method, subject matter, and flexibility.

### 3.3.1 Classification by Duration

#### **A. Voyage Policy**

**Definition:** Covers the subject matter for a specific voyage from one port to another, regardless of time taken.

**Coverage Period:**
- Begins when ship leaves the departure port
- Ends when ship arrives at destination port
- Duration determined by voyage, not calendar time

**Characteristics:**
- Most traditional form of marine insurance
- Risk varies with specific voyage
- Premium based on route, season, cargo type
- Coverage automatic for delays (unless due to deviation)

**Example:**

*"$500,000 on cargo of ready-made garments per vessel MV Asia Star from Chittagong, Bangladesh to Rotterdam, Netherlands"*

**Coverage:**
- Starts: When vessel leaves Chittagong port
- Ends: When vessel arrives at Rotterdam port
- Duration: Typically 20-30 days, but continues if delayed by storms or other covered perils

**Use Cases:**
- Single shipments by exporters/importers
- Irregular or one-time shipments
- When specific voyage risk assessment needed

**Premium Factors:**
- Distance and route
- Season (monsoon vs. calm season)
- Vessel quality and age
- Type of cargo
- Port facilities
- Political situation along route

**Transit Clause:**

Modern voyage policies often include "warehouse to warehouse" coverage, extending beyond the voyage itself:

- Attaches when goods leave warehouse for shipment
- Continues during ordinary transit
- Includes transshipment if needed
- Terminates when goods delivered to final warehouse
- Or 60 days after discharge (whichever first)

**Example with Transit Clause:**

*Garments manufactured in Dhaka, trucked to Chittagong port, shipped to Hamburg, then trucked to final warehouse in Munich.*

**Coverage Period:**
1. Leaves factory warehouse in Dhaka
2. Truck to Chittagong (covered)
3. Stored at port temporarily (covered)
4. Loaded on ship (covered)
5. Sea voyage (covered)
6. Discharged at Hamburg (covered)
7. Stored briefly (covered)
8. Truck to Munich (covered)
9. Delivered to final warehouse (coverage ends)

**Maximum Duration:** 60 days after discharge in Hamburg, even if not yet in Munich.

#### **B. Time Policy**

**Definition:** Covers the subject matter for a specified period of time, regardless of voyages undertaken during that period.

**Coverage Period:**
- Fixed time duration (typically 12 months)
- Begins at specified date and time
- Ends exactly at expiry date and time
- Not affected by number of voyages

**Characteristics:**
- Calendar-based coverage
- Convenient for vessels making multiple voyages
- Premium based on time, not specific routes
- Requires renewal after expiry

**Example:**

*"Hull and machinery of MV Pacific Trader, valued at $15 million, covered for 12 months from January 1, 2024, 12:00 noon to January 1, 2025, 12:00 noon"*

**Coverage:**
- All voyages during the 12-month period
- Ship could make 20-30 voyages during this time
- Geographic limits may apply (e.g., worldwide excluding war zones)

**Use Cases:**
- Hull insurance for commercial vessels
- Protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance
- Freight insurance for carriers
- Ships making regular, multiple voyages

**Premium Factors:**
- Type and age of vessel
- Trading areas (coastal vs. ocean-going)
- Vessel management quality
- Claims history
- Crew competence

**Geographic Limits:**

Time policies often specify trading limits:

**Example:**

*"Warranted vessel does not trade north of 60° N latitude or south of 40° S latitude during winter months (November-March)"*

This excludes dangerous Arctic and Antarctic waters during storms.

**Held Covered Clause:**

If vessel accidentally breaches limits, coverage continues at an additional premium to be arranged:

*"Held covered in case of breach of warranty as to trading limits, at a premium to be agreed"*

#### **C. Mixed Policy (Voyage and Time)**

**Definition:** Combines both voyage and time elements, covering a specific voyage but with a maximum time limit.

**Structure:**
- Primarily voyage-based
- But includes maximum time limit
- Coverage terminates at earlier of: voyage completion or time expiry

**Characteristics:**
- Less common than pure voyage or time policies
- Protects insurer against indefinite delays
- Useful for voyages with uncertain duration

**Example:**

*"$1 million on machinery cargo per MV Trade Wind from Shanghai to Chittagong, maximum 90 days"*

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Normal Voyage:**
- Ship leaves Shanghai January 10
- Arrives Chittagong February 5 (26 days)
- Coverage ends February 5 (voyage complete within time limit)

**Scenario B - Delayed Voyage:**
- Ship leaves Shanghai January 10
- Encounters multiple storms, seeks shelter, makes repairs
- Arrives Chittagong April 15 (95 days)
- **Coverage ended April 10 (90 days expired)**
- Last 5 days uninsured

**Use Cases:**
- Voyages through unpredictable waters
- When maximum exposure time needs to be limited
- Balancing flexibility with insurer protection

### 3.3.2 Classification by Valuation

#### **A. Valued Policy**

**Definition:** A policy where the value of the subject matter is agreed upon and stated in the policy at inception. This agreed value is conclusive in case of total loss.

**Characteristics:**
- Value predetermined and specified in policy
- Eliminates valuation disputes in total loss
- Insured and insurer agree on value upfront
- Particularly common in marine cargo insurance

**How It Works:**

**At Policy Inception:**
- Insured proposes value
- Insurer agrees or negotiates
- Agreed value written into policy

**At Total Loss:**
- No need to prove actual value
- Agreed value paid automatically (subject to policy limit)
- Significantly simplifies claims

**Example:**

*Policy states: "Valued at $800,000 on cargo of electronics per MV Ocean Carrier"*

**Total Loss Scenario:**
- Cargo completely destroyed
- No dispute about value
- **Claim paid: $800,000** (less deductible)
- No need to produce purchase invoices, market valuations, etc.

**Partial Loss Scenario:**
- 30% of cargo damaged
- **Claim paid: $800,000 × 30% = $240,000** (less deductible)
- Based on proportion of agreed value

**Advantages:**

✓ **Certainty:** Both parties know compensation amount upfront  
✓ **Speed:** Total loss claims settled quickly without valuation disputes  
✓ **Simplicity:** No need for complex valuation at claim time  
✓ **Planning:** Insured can plan finances knowing exact coverage  
✓ **Trade Practice:** Facilitates letter of credit transactions (banks prefer valued policies)

**Disadvantages:**

✗ **Over-Insurance Risk:** Insured might inflate value (moral hazard)  
✗ **Under-Insurance:** Insured might undervalue to save premium  
✗ **Market Changes:** Agreed value may not reflect market changes during voyage  
✗ **Disputes on Valuation:** Disagreement on "agreed value" at policy inception

**Valuation Basis for Cargo (Typical):**

**Agreed Value = Prime Cost + Freight + Insurance + Expected Profit**

Also known as "CIF + 10%" formula:
- **C**ost of goods
- **I**nsurance premium
- **F**reight charges
- **+ 10%** (or agreed percentage) for expected profit and additional charges

**Example Calculation:**

*Electronics purchased for export:*
- Purchase price (prime cost): $500,000
- Freight charges: $40,000
- Insurance premium: $6,000
- Expected profit margin (10%): $50,000
- **Agreed Value: $596,000**

Policy written: "Valued at $596,000"

**Important Legal Point:**

While agreed value is conclusive for total loss, it doesn't override the principle of indemnity. If fraud is proven (e.g., grossly inflated value), courts may set aside the valuation.

#### **B. Unvalued Policy (Open Policy)**

**Definition:** A policy where the value of the subject matter is not agreed upon in advance. The insured must prove the actual value at the time of loss.

**Characteristics:**
- No predetermined value
- Policy states sum insured (maximum limit)
- Actual value determined after loss
- Insured must provide evidence of value

**How It Works:**

**At Policy Inception:**
- Policy specifies maximum sum insured
- No agreed value stated
- Example: "Sum insured: Up to $1,000,000"

**At Loss:**
- Insured must prove actual value
- Provide purchase invoices, bills of lading
- Market valuations if needed
- Insurer investigates and assesses
- Payment based on proven value, up to policy limit

**Example:**

*Policy states: "Sum insured up to $1,000,000 on general cargo"*

**Total Loss Scenario:**
- Cargo completely lost
- Insured provides documentation:
  - Purchase invoices: $700,000
  - Freight paid: $50,000
  - Other charges: $20,000
  - **Proven value: $770,000**
- **Claim paid: $770,000** (proven value, within policy limit)

**If Proven Value Exceeds Limit:**
- Proven value: $1,100,000
- Policy limit: $1,000,000
- **Claim paid: $1,000,000** (policy limit, insured bears $100,000 loss)

**Advantages:**

✓ **Flexibility:** No need to agree exact value upfront  
✓ **Premium Savings:** Can insure for maximum possible value without committing to specific valuation  
✓ **Accuracy:** Payment reflects actual value at loss  
✓ **No Over-Insurance:** Prevents insured from over-insuring

**Disadvantages:**

✗ **Uncertainty:** Compensation amount unknown until claim  
✗ **Documentation Burden:** Must prove value with evidence  
✗ **Valuation Disputes:** Disagreements on actual value common  
✗ **Delays:** Claims take longer to settle  
✗ **Under-Insurance Risk:** Inadequate sum insured may leave gap

**Comparison: Valued vs. Unvalued**

| **Aspect** | **Valued Policy** | **Unvalued Policy** |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Value Determination** | Agreed at inception | Determined at loss |
| **Total Loss Payment** | Agreed value (automatic) | Proven actual value |
| **Documentation Needed** | Minimal | Extensive |
| **Claim Settlement Speed** | Fast | Slower |
| **Disputes** | Rare (value pre-agreed) | Common (value disputed) |
| **Flexibility** | Low | High |
| **Common Usage** | Cargo insurance | Hull insurance |
| **Letter of Credit** | Preferred by banks | Less preferred |

**Practical Usage:**

- **Cargo Insurance:** Usually valued policies (trade needs certainty)
- **Hull Insurance:** Often unvalued (vessel value fluctuates, verifiable through surveys)
- **Freight Insurance:** Can be either, depending on circumstances

### 3.3.3 Classification by Scope and Flexibility

#### **A. Specific Policy**

**Definition:** Covers a single shipment or single vessel for one voyage or specified period.

**Characteristics:**
- One-time coverage
- Specific subject matter identified
- Issued for individual transaction
- Policy exhausted after single voyage or claim

**Example:**

*"$300,000 on 500 cartons of pharmaceuticals per MV Health Carrier from Mumbai to Chittagong"*

This policy covers ONLY:
- These specific 500 cartons
- On this specific vessel
- For this specific voyage

**Use Cases:**
- Infrequent shippers
- High-value single shipments
- Special or unusual cargo
- One-time transactions

**Advantages:**
- Precise coverage
- No minimum premium commitments
- Flexibility for occasional shipments

**Disadvantages:**
- Must arrange new policy for each shipment
- Administrative burden
- May be more expensive per shipment
- Time-consuming

#### **B. Floating Policy (Open Cover)**

**Definition:** A policy that covers multiple shipments over a period of time up to an aggregate limit. Each shipment is "declared" to the insurer as it occurs.

**Characteristics:**
- Blanket coverage for multiple shipments
- Period usually 12 months
- Aggregate limit (maximum total)
- Individual shipments declared as they happen
- Premium paid on declarations

**Structure:**

1. **Agreement Phase:**
   - Insured and insurer agree on terms
   - Set aggregate limit (e.g., $10 million)
   - Define types of cargo covered
   - Establish routes and vessels
   - Agree premium rates

2. **Operational Phase:**
   - Each shipment declared to insurer (name of vessel, cargo details, value)
   - Declaration usually required within specified time (e.g., before shipment or immediately after)
   - Premium calculated and paid for each declaration
   - Aggregate limit reduces with each declaration

3. **Renewal:**
   - Policy renewed annually
   - Terms renegotiated if needed

**Example:**

*ABC Traders arranges floating policy:*
- Aggregate limit: $5 million
- Period: January 1 - December 31, 2024
- Coverage: Textiles from Bangladesh to Europe
- Rate: 0.5% of declared value

**Shipment 1 (February):**
- Declares: $200,000 of textiles on MV Star
- Premium: $200,000 × 0.5% = $1,000
- Remaining limit: $5 million - $200,000 = $4.8 million

**Shipment 2 (March):**
- Declares: $300,000 of textiles on MV Ocean
- Premium: $300,000 × 0.5% = $1,500
- Remaining limit: $4.8 million - $300,000 = $4.5 million

**Continues throughout year...**

**Advantages:**

✓ **Convenience:** One policy covers all shipments  
✓ **Automatic Coverage:** Each shipment automatically covered upon declaration  
✓ **Cost Effective:** Usually lower overall premiums than individual policies  
✓ **Cash Flow:** Pay premium only when goods shipped  
✓ **Administrative Efficiency:** Reduces paperwork  
✓ **Relationship Building:** Ongoing relationship with insurer

**Disadvantages:**

✗ **Declaration Requirement:** Must remember to declare each shipment  
✗ **Non-Declaration Risk:** Failure to declare may void coverage for that shipment  
✗ **Aggregate Limit:** May exhaust limit before year end  
✗ **Commitment:** Usually requires minimum activity level

**Declaration Requirements:**

Policies specify when declarations must be made:

**Before Shipment:** Safest but requires advance planning  
**At Shipment:** Common requirement  
**Within X Days After Shipment:** Provides flexibility  
**Monthly Summary:** Less common, requires trust

**Example Clause:**

*"The insured undertakes to declare all shipments immediately upon dispatch, and in any event within 48 hours. Failure to declare within the stipulated time will result in no coverage for that shipment."*

**Non-Declaration Consequences:**

**Scenario:** Insured forgets to declare a $100,000 shipment within required timeframe. Shipment is lost.

**Outcome:**
- No coverage for this shipment
- Insured bears full $100,000 loss
- Even though aggregate limit had capacity

**Lesson:** Declaration discipline is critical under floating policies.

**Ideal For:**
- Regular exporters/importers
- Businesses with frequent shipments
- Companies with predictable shipping patterns
- Those seeking administrative efficiency

#### **C. Blanket Policy**

**Definition:** Similar to floating policy but covers all shipments automatically without requiring individual declarations.

**Characteristics:**
- Automatic coverage for all shipments
- No declaration required
- Premium based on estimated annual shipments
- Periodic adjustment based on actual shipments
- Broader and more convenient than floating policy

**How It Works:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Estimate annual shipment value
   - Pay deposit premium based on estimate
   - All shipments automatically covered

2. **During Policy Period:**
   - Ship freely without declarations
   - Keep records of all shipments

3. **Policy End/Audit:**
   - Submit records of actual shipments
   - Adjustment premium paid if actual exceeded estimate
   - Refund if actual less than estimate

**Example:**

*XYZ Exports arranges blanket policy:*
- Estimated annual shipments: $8 million
- Rate: 0.6%
- Deposit Premium: $8 million × 0.6% = $48,000 paid upfront

**During year, actual shipments total $9.2 million**

**Year-End Adjustment:**

## 3.4 Marine Losses

Understanding marine losses is critical to marine insurance. Losses are classified in multiple ways, and proper classification determines the extent of coverage and settlement method.

### 3.4.1 Classification of Marine Losses

Marine losses can be classified into two primary categories based on extent of loss:

1. **Total Loss** (complete destruction or total deprivation)
2. **Partial Loss** (incomplete damage or loss)

These further subdivide into important subcategories.

### 3.4.2 Total Loss

**Total Loss** occurs when the subject matter is completely destroyed or the insured is irretrievably deprived of it.

Total loss is subdivided into:
- **Actual Total Loss**
- **Constructive Total Loss**

This distinction is crucial and unique to marine insurance.

#### **A. Actual Total Loss (ATL)**

**Definition:** The subject matter is physically destroyed, or so damaged that it ceases to be a thing of the kind insured, or the insured is irretrievably deprived of it.

**Situations Constituting Actual Total Loss:**

**1. Physical Destruction:**

The subject matter is completely destroyed and ceases to exist in its original form.

**Examples:**
- Ship burned to ashes
- Cargo completely consumed by fire
- Ship broken up by storms into fragments
- Cargo dissolved or contaminated beyond recognition

**Scenario:**

*MV Cargo Queen, carrying textiles, catches fire at sea. Despite firefighting efforts, the ship burns completely and sinks. Nothing is salvageable.*

*Result:* Actual total loss of both ship and cargo.

**2. Ceases to Be the Thing Insured:**

The subject matter is so fundamentally altered that it is no longer the same kind of thing.

**Examples:**
- Rice cargo becomes completely waterlogged, ferments, and becomes animal feed (no longer rice)
- Fresh fruit completely rots and becomes waste
- Wine spoils and becomes vinegar
- Cement hardens into unusable solid blocks

**Scenario:**

*Shipment of fresh mangoes from Bangladesh to UK. Refrigeration system fails. Mangoes completely rot and decompose during voyage.*

*Result:* Actual total loss. The mangoes ceased to be fresh fruit (the thing insured).

**Important Distinction:**

If mangoes were partially damaged but still marketable (even at reduced price), this would be partial loss, not total loss.

**3. Irretrievable Deprivation:**

The insured is permanently deprived of the subject matter, even if it still physically exists somewhere.

**Examples:**
- Ship captured by pirates and never recovered
- Cargo seized by foreign government and confiscated
- Ship sinks in such deep water that recovery is impossible
- Cargo jettisoned (thrown overboard) to save ship

**Scenario:**

*MV Trade Ship carrying electronics is hijacked by pirates off Somalia. Despite international efforts, ship and cargo are never recovered. Pirates eventually scuttle the ship.*

*Result:* Actual total loss. Owner is irretrievably deprived, even though cargo physically existed for some time after capture.

**4. Missing Ship:**

If a ship is missing and no news is received for a reasonable time, it is presumed to be an actual total loss.

**Reasonable Time:** Usually 3-6 months without any communication.

**Scenario:**

*MV Ocean Star departs Chittagong for Singapore on January 15. Expected arrival: January 25. By March 15 (60 days later), no communication received despite extensive search and inquiry.*

*Result:* Presumed actual total loss. Ship considered lost.

**Legal Presumption:**

After reasonable time without news, the law presumes actual total loss. The insured can claim without proving what actually happened to the ship.

**Notice of Abandonment NOT Required:**

For actual total loss, the insured does NOT need to serve notice of abandonment. The insurer simply pays the claim (subject to policy terms).

**Payment for Actual Total Loss:**

**Valued Policy:**
- Pay agreed value (full sum insured)
- No deduction except policy deductible

**Unvalued Policy:**
- Pay proven insurable value
- Up to sum insured limit
- Insured must provide evidence of value

**Example:**

*Valued policy: Cargo valued at $500,000  
Actual Total Loss occurs  
Claim Payment: **$500,000** (less any deductible)*

**Salvage Rights:**

When insurer pays actual total loss claim:
- All rights in the subject matter transfer to insurer
- Insurer owns any salvage
- If salvage recovered and sold, insurer keeps proceeds

**Example:**

*Ship insured for $10 million suffers actual total loss. Insurer pays claim. Later, wreck is raised and sold for scrap for $500,000.*

*Result:* Insurer keeps the $500,000 salvage proceeds. Net cost to insurer: $9.5 million.

#### **B. Constructive Total Loss (CTL)**

**Definition:** The subject matter is not actually totally lost, but the cost of recovery or repair would exceed its value, making it economically unreasonable to recover or repair it. The insured may treat it as a total loss.

**This is a unique and important concept in marine insurance.**

**Rationale:**

It would be unreasonable to force the insured to spend more than the thing is worth to recover or repair it. Law permits treating such situations as total loss.

**Situations Constituting Constructive Total Loss:**

**1. Cost of Repairs Exceeds Value (Ship):**

The reasonable cost of repairing damage exceeds the insured value of the ship when repaired.

**Example:**

*MV Trader (insured value: $5 million) suffers severe storm damage.*

**Repair Estimates:**
- Hull repairs: $3 million
- Engine replacement: $2 million
- Structural repairs: $1.5 million
- **Total repair cost: $6.5 million**

**Analysis:**
- Repair cost ($6.5M) > Insured value ($5M)
- Unreasonable to spend $6.5M to repair ship worth $5M
- **Constructive Total Loss**

**2. Cost of Recovery + Repairs Exceeds Value (Cargo):**

The cost of recovering and forwarding cargo to destination, plus any necessary repairs, exceeds the value at destination.

**Example:**

*Cargo of machinery (insured value: $200,000) destined for Dhaka. Ship founders near Sri Lanka. Cargo salvageable but submerged.*

**Cost Analysis:**
- Salvage operation cost: $80,000
- Repair/refurbishment of machinery: $90,000
- Forwarding to Dhaka: $40,000
- **Total: $210,000**

**Value at destination if recovered: $200,000**

**Analysis:**
- Recovery/repair cost ($210,000) > Value ($200,000)
- Unreasonable to spend $210,000 to recover $200,000 worth of cargo
- **Constructive Total Loss**

**3. Irreparable Damage:**

The subject matter is so damaged that repairs are impossible, even though it physically exists.

**Example:**

*Modern container ship with computerized navigation suffers saltwater flooding of all electronic systems. Technology is so specialized that replacement systems are no longer manufactured.*

**4. Prevented from Arriving (Ship):**

A ship is prevented by a peril insured against from completing the voyage, and it appears highly unlikely it will be able to do so.

**Example:**

*Ship damaged in storm, takes refuge in remote port. Political unrest closes the port indefinitely. Ship cannot leave and cannot complete voyage.*

**Notice of Abandonment - REQUIRED:**

Unlike actual total loss, for constructive total loss, the insured MUST:

1. **Serve Notice of Abandonment** on the insurer
2. **Abandon the subject matter** to the insurer
3. **Claim as if it were actual total loss**

**Why Notice Required:**

Constructive total loss is a choice—the insured could theoretically recover/repair the property. By claiming CTL, the insured is saying "I'm abandoning this to you; pay me as for total loss."

The notice gives the insurer the opportunity to:
- Accept the abandonment
- Decline and assess as partial loss instead
- Investigate the circumstances
- Take possession and attempt salvage if desired

**Form of Notice:**

Must be:
- In writing
- Clear and unconditional
- Served promptly (without unreasonable delay)
- Indicate intention to abandon

**Example Notice:**

*"To: Marine Insurance Company  
Date: [Date]  
Subject: Notice of Abandonment - Policy No. [XXX]  

We hereby give notice of abandonment of the vessel MV Ocean Trader which sustained damage in storm on [date] and has become a constructive total loss. We claim for total loss under policy No. [XXX].  

The vessel and all interests therein are abandoned to you.  

Signed: [Insured]"*

**Insurer's Response Options:**

**Option 1: Accept Abandonment**
- Acknowledge constructive total loss
- Pay total loss claim
- Take ownership of subject matter and any salvage

**Option 2: Decline Abandonment**
- Dispute that it's a constructive total loss
- Offer to settle as partial loss only
- Matter may go to dispute resolution

**Option 3: Neither Accept nor Decline**
- Investigate further
- Eventually must take a position

**If Notice Not Served:**

Failure to serve notice of abandonment:
- Insured loses right to claim constructive total loss
- Can only claim partial loss
- Even if technically it was a CTL situation

**This is a critical procedural requirement unique to marine insurance.**

**Example - Failure to Serve Notice:**

*Ship suffers $7 million damage, insured value $5 million (clear CTL). Insured fails to serve notice of abandonment, just files claim. Three months later claims CTL.*

*Result:* Notice was not served promptly. Insurer can reject CTL claim. Insured limited to partial loss claim (capped at policy limits).

**Payment for Constructive Total Loss:**

If abandonment accepted:
- Pay as for actual total loss
- Valued policy: Pay agreed value
- Unvalued policy: Pay proven insurable value
- Insurer takes ownership of subject matter

**Salvage Operations:**

Once insurer accepts abandonment and pays:
- Insurer owns the subject matter
- Insurer may attempt salvage operations
- Any salvage proceeds belong to insurer
- Insurer bears salvage costs

**Example:**

*Cargo insured for $300,000 becomes CTL. Insurer accepts abandonment and pays $300,000. Insurer arranges salvage operation:*
- Salvage cost: $50,000
- Salvage sold for: $80,000
- **Net salvage benefit to insurer: $30,000**
- **Insurer's net loss: $300,000 - $30,000 = $270,000**

**Comparison: Actual Total Loss vs. Constructive Total Loss**

| **Aspect** | **Actual Total Loss** | **Constructive Total Loss** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Physical Condition** | Destroyed or irretrievably gone | Still exists but economically unreasonable to recover |
| **Notice of Abandonment** | NOT required | REQUIRED |
| **Insured's Choice** | No choice (it's gone) | Must choose to abandon |
| **Payment** | Automatic (if claim valid) | Only if abandonment accepted |
| **Salvage** | Belongs to insurer if recovered | Insurer takes ownership upon abandonment |
| **Proof** | Must prove total loss occurred | Must prove recovery cost exceeds value |

### 3.4.3 Partial Loss

**Partial Loss** occurs when the subject matter is damaged but not totally lost—it still exists and retains some value.

Partial losses are subdivided into:
- **Particular Average**
- **General Average**

This subdivision is unique and critically important in marine insurance.

#### **A. Particular Average (PA)**

**Definition:** A partial loss of the subject matter insured, caused by a peril insured against, which is not a general average loss.

**"Particular"** means:
- Affects only one party's interest (one cargo owner, or the shipowner)
- Loss falls on that party alone (unless insured)
- Not shared among all parties to the maritime adventure

**"Average"** is a historical marine insurance term meaning "loss" or "damage."

**Characteristics:**

- **Partial damage** to ship or cargo
- Caused by **insured peril**
- Falls on **owner of damaged property** alone
- Other cargo owners not affected
- Claim paid by insurer under normal policy terms

**Examples of Particular Average:**

**1. Cargo Damage:**

*Scenario:* Ship carrying 100 containers encounters storm. 10 containers belonging to ABC Company are damaged by water ingress. Other containers unaffected.

*Analysis:*
- Partial loss (only 10% of cargo affected)
- Affects only ABC Company
- Other cargo owners unaffected
- **Particular Average Loss**

*Settlement:*
- ABC Company claims from their cargo insurer
- Other cargo owners make no claim
- Shipowner not involved (unless ship also damaged)

**2. Ship Damage:**

*Scenario:* Ship strikes submerged object, damaging hull plating and requiring $200,000 in repairs. Ship value: $10 million.

*Analysis:*
- Partial loss (ship still functions after repair)
- Affects only shipowner
- Cargo owners not affected
- **Particular Average Loss**

*Settlement:*
- Shipowner claims from hull insurer
- Cargo owners unaffected
- Each party bears own loss

**3. Theft of Specific Cargo:**

*Scenario:* During port operations, thieves steal 50 boxes from XYZ Company's shipment. Other cargo secure.

*Analysis:*
- Partial loss (only part of XYZ's cargo)
- Affects only XYZ Company
- **Particular Average Loss**

*Settlement:*
- XYZ claims from their cargo insurer
- No involvement of other parties

**Coverage Under Policies:**

**Institute Cargo Clauses:**

Modern cargo policies use standardized clauses:

| **Clause Type** | **Coverage** | **Particular Average** |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Clause A (All Risks)** | Broadest coverage | Covered (unless specifically excluded) |
| **Clause B (Named Perils)** | Limited named perils | Covered for named perils only |
| **Clause C (Minimum)** | Very limited | Covered only for major casualties |

**Free of Particular Average (FPA):**

Some policies include "FPA" clause excluding particular average losses unless:
- Total loss occurs, OR
- Ship strands, sinks, burns, or collides

**Example FPA Clause:**

*"Warranted free of particular average unless the vessel be stranded, sunk, burnt, on fire, or in collision"*

**Effect:**
- Minor partial losses NOT covered
- Only major casualties or total loss covered
- Reduces premium significantly

**Scenario with FPA:**

*Policy includes FPA clause. During voyage, 20% of cargo damaged by seawater from heavy weather.*

*Result:* **NOT covered** under FPA clause (ship didn't strand, sink, burn, or collide). Insured bears the loss.

*However:* If ship had struck rocks (stranded) AND cargo damaged, then **covered**.

**Deductibles in Particular Average:**

Policies typically include deductibles (franchises):

**1. Straight Deductible:**
- Fixed amount deducted from every claim
- Example: $5,000 deductible

**2. Franchise:**
- No payment unless loss exceeds threshold
- If exceeds, full amount paid

**Example:**

*Cargo insured for $100,000 with 3% franchise. Loss: $2,500*
- 3% of $100,000 = $3,000
- Loss ($2,500) < Franchise ($3,000)
- **No claim payment**

*If loss were $4,000:*
- Loss exceeds franchise
- **Full $4,000 paid** (no deduction)

#### **B. General Average (GA)**

**Definition:** A loss caused by a voluntary and extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure made intentionally and reasonably to preserve property involved in a common maritime adventure from a common peril.

**This is a unique and ancient principle of maritime law, predating insurance.**

**Fundamental Principle:**

When part of a maritime adventure is voluntarily sacrificed to save the whole, all parties whose property was saved must contribute proportionally to compensate the party who suffered the loss.

**Key Requirements for General Average:**

1. **Common Maritime Adventure:**
   - Ship, cargo, and freight engaged in sea voyage together
   - All exposed to same peril

2. **Common Peril:**
   - Danger threatening the entire adventure
   - Must be real and imminent

3. **Voluntary Act:**
   - Intentional, deliberate action
   - Not accidental or forced by circumstances
   - Made by person in charge (usually master/captain)

4. **Extraordinary:**
   - Beyond normal operation
   - Not routine or expected

5. **Reasonable:**
   - Prudent measure under circumstances
   - Purpose is to save the adventure

6. **Successful (partially or wholly):**
   - Some property saved as a result
   - If everything lost, no general average

**ALL these elements must be present for General Average.**

**Classic Example - Jettison:**

*Scenario:* Ship in severe storm, taking on water, listing dangerously. Captain determines ship will sink unless weight reduced immediately. Orders 100 tons of cargo (belonging to Company A) thrown overboard. Ship survives, reaches port safely with remaining cargo.

*Analysis:*

1. **Common adventure?** ✓ Yes (ship and all cargo)
2. **Common peril?** ✓ Yes (ship sinking threatens all)
3. **Voluntary?** ✓ Yes (captain's deliberate decision)
4. **Extraordinary?** ✓ Yes (not routine operation)
5. **Reasonable?** ✓ Yes (necessary to save ship)
6. **Successful?** ✓ Yes (ship and remaining cargo saved)

**Result: GENERAL AVERAGE**

**Contribution:**

Company A's jettisoned cargo value: $500,000

**Saved Values:**
- Ship: $10 million
- Remaining cargo (various owners): $5 million
- Freight: $300,000
- **Total saved: $15.3 million**

**Company A's sacrifice: $500,000**

**How General Average is Shared:**

Each party contributes in proportion to the value of their saved property:

| **Party** | **Saved Value** | **Proportion** | **Contribution** |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Shipowner | $10,000,000 | 65.36% | $326,800 |
| Other cargo owners | $5,000,000 | 32.68% | $163,400 |
| Freight owner | $300,000 | 1.96% | $9,800 |
| **Company A (sacrificed cargo)** | $0 | 0% | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | **$15,300,000** | **100%** | **$500,000** |

**Result:**
- Company A receives $500,000 (compensation for sacrifice)
- Shipowner pays $326,800
- Other cargo owners collectively pay $163,400
- Freight owner pays $9,800
- **Net cost distributed fairly among all who benefited**

**Common General Average Situations:**

**1. Jettison of Cargo:**
- Throwing cargo overboard to save ship
- Most classic example

**2. Voluntary Stranding:**
- Intentionally running ship aground to prevent sinking
- Damage to ship is general average

**Scenario:* Ship taking on water rapidly. Captain deliberately beaches ship on sandy shore to prevent sinking. Ship damaged but cargo saved.*

*Result:* Damage to ship from voluntary stranding is general average. All cargo owners contribute.

**3. Damage from Firefighting:**
- Water damage to cargo while fighting fire
- Smoke damage from deliberate flooding

**Scenario:** Fire in one cargo hold. Captain floods hold with water, damaging cargo in that hold, but preventing fire spread. Other holds' cargo saved.

*Result:* Water-damaged cargo is general average sacrifice. All saved parties contribute.

**4. Port of Refuge Expenses:**
- Ship enters port for emergency repairs
- Extra port charges, cargo handling, storage

**Scenario:** Ship damaged in storm, must enter nearest port for repairs. Incurs $100,000 in extra port fees, tug charges, and cargo handling that wouldn't occur in normal voyage.

*Result:* These extraordinary expenses are general average. All parties contribute.

**5. Salvage Charges:**
- Professional salvors hired to save ship and cargo
- Salvage fees paid

**6. Temporary Repairs:**
- Emergency repairs to enable ship to reach final destination

**General Average vs. Particular Average Comparison:**

| **Aspect** | **Particular Average** | **General Average** |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Nature** | Accidental damage/loss | Voluntary sacrifice/expenditure |
| **Purpose** | N/A (accidental) | To save common adventure |
| **Loss Bearer** | Owner of damaged property | Shared among all parties proportionally |
| **Trigger** | Insured peril causes damage | Deliberate act to prevent greater loss |
| **Insurance Coverage** | Covered by own policy | Covered by own policy + recovers contribution from others |
| **Examples** | Storm damage, theft, collision damage | Jettison, voluntary stranding, firefighting damage |

**Practical Example Illustrating Difference:**

**Particular Average Scenario:**
- Storm damages 30% of Cargo A
- **Result:** Cargo A owner claims from their insurer
- Other cargo owners unaffected

**General Average Scenario:**
- Storm threatens to sink ship
- Captain jettisons 100% of Cargo A to save ship
- All other cargo saved
- **Result:** All saved parties (shipowner + all other cargo owners) contribute to compensate Cargo A owner

**General Average Procedure:**

**Step 1: Declaration**
- Master/captain declares general average
- Issues "General Average Bond"

**Step 2: Documentation**
- All circumstances recorded
- Surveyors appointed

**Step 3: Security**
- Cargo owners must provide:
  - General Average Bond (promise to pay share)
  - Cash deposit or guarantee (typically via insurer)
- Cargo not released until security provided

**Step 4: Average Adjustment**
- Specialist "Average Adjuster" calculates:
  - Value of sacrifice/expenditure
  - Saved values
  - Each party's proportion
- Prepares "General Average Statement"
- Can take months or years

**Step 5: Settlement**
- Each party pays their contribution
- Party who suffered sacrifice/made expenditure receives total
- Usually handled through insurers

**Insurance Coverage for General Average:**

**From Insured's Perspective:**

**If your cargo is sacrificed:**
- Your cargo insurer pays you for the sacrifice
- Insurer then collects contributions from other parties (subrogation)

**If your cargo is saved:**
- You owe contribution to others
- Your cargo insurer pays your contribution on your behalf
- Covered under your policy

**Result:** Either way, if properly insured, you're protected.

**Example:**

*Company X's cargo (insured for $200,000) is jettisoned to save ship and other cargo. Total saved values: $10 million.*

**From Company X:**
1. Loses $200,000 of cargo
2. Claims $200,000 from own insurer
3. Insurer pays Company X
4. Insurer then collects proportional contributions from all other parties
5. **Company X made whole**

**From Other Cargo Owner Y (cargo value $1 million, saved):**
1. Owes contribution: ($1M/$10M) × $200,000 = $20,000
2. Company Y's insurer pays the $20,000 on Y's behalf
3. **Company Y not out of pocket**

**Both companies fully protected by their insurance.**

**York-Antwerp Rules:**

International standardized rules governing general average, adopted by most maritime nations. Provides uniform method of calculating general average regardless of where loss occurs.

**Importance:**

Ship from Panama, cargo from Bangladesh, incident in international waters, destination Germany—which country's laws apply?

**Answer:** York-Antwerp Rules provide uniformity.

## 3.5 Claims and Settlement

### 3.5.1 Claims Process in Marine Insurance

The marine insurance claims process is more complex than other insurance types due to international nature, multiple parties, and specialized losses.

**Initial Steps After Loss:**

**1. Immediate Notification:**
- Notify insurer immediately upon discovering loss
- Delay can jeopardize claim
- Use "advice of loss" or casualty notification

**2. Minimize Loss:**
- Insured has duty to take reasonable measures to minimize loss
- Sue and labor clause: Insurer reimburses reasonable loss prevention costs
- Example: Hiring salvors, emergency repairs, protecting undamaged cargo

**3. Preserve Evidence:**
- Document damage with photos/videos
- Preserve damaged goods for inspection
- Maintain all relevant documents

**4. Obtain Surveys:**
- Arrange independent surveyor inspection
- Surveyor prepares detailed report
- Essential for claim substantiation

### 3.5.2 Documentation Required

**Standard Documents:**

1. **Claim Form:** Completed by insured

2. **Insurance Policy/Certificate:** Proof of coverage

**Hull Surveyor:**
- Inspects ship damage
- Recommends repairs
- Supervises repair work

**Average Adjuster:**
- Specializes in general average
- Calculates contributions
- Prepares GA statement

**Survey Report Contents:**

- Date and location of survey
- Description of subject matter
- Circumstances of loss
- Extent of damage
- Cause of damage (opinion)
- Recommendations
- Estimated costs
- Salvage value assessment
- Photos and supporting documents

### 3.5.4 Settlement Methods

**1. Cash Payment:**
- Most common
- Insurer pays agreed amount
- Insured handles repairs/replacement

**2. Repair Authorization:**
- Insurer arranges and pays for repairs directly
- Common for hull insurance

**3. Replacement:**
- Insurer provides replacement goods
- Less common in marine insurance

**4. Salvage Adjustment:**
- Payment reduced by salvage value
- Insurer may take possession of salvage

### 3.5.5 Settlement Examples

**Example 1: Partial Loss of Cargo**

*Scenario:*
- $500,000 cargo of electronics insured under Clause A
- 40% damaged by seawater during storm
- Salvage value of damaged goods: $50,000

*Survey Findings:*
- 40% totally damaged beyond repair
- 60% undamaged
- Cause: Storm (covered peril)

*Calculation:*
- Total insured value: $500,000
- Damage percentage: 40%
- Gross loss: $500,000 × 40% = $200,000
- Less salvage value: $50,000
- **Net Claim: $150,000**

*Settlement:*
- Insurer pays $150,000
- Insured keeps all cargo (damaged and undamaged)
- Or insured may abandon damaged cargo to insurer for salvage

**Example 2: Constructive Total Loss**

*Scenario:*
- Ship (insured value $8 million) severely damaged in collision
- Repair estimate: $9.5 million
- Salvage value of damaged ship: $1.2 million

*Process:*
1. Insured serves Notice of Abandonment
2. Insurer investigates
3. Confirms repair cost exceeds value
4. Accepts abandonment

*Settlement:*
- Insurer pays $8 million (insured value)
- Takes ownership of damaged ship
- Sells for salvage: $1.2 million
- **Net cost to insurer: $6.8 million**

**Example 3: General Average**

*Scenario:*
- Ship value: $15 million
- Total cargo value: $10 million (multiple owners)
- Freight at risk: $500,000
- Fire in engine room
- Captain floods engine room ($2 million damage) to save ship
- All cargo saved

*General Average Declaration:*
- Sacrifice: $2 million engine damage
- Saved values: $25.5 million total ($15M + $10M + $0.5M)

*Settlement:*
- Average adjuster prepares statement
- Each party contributes proportionally:
  - Shipowner: ($15M/$25.5M) × $2M = $1,176,471
  - Cargo owners: ($10M/$25.5M) × $2M = $784,314
  - Freight: ($0.5M/$25.5M) × $2M = $39,215

*Insurance Impact:*
- Shipowner's hull insurer pays:
  - $2M sacrifice PLUS
  - Shipowner's own $1,176,471 contribution MINUS
  - Collections from others
- Each cargo owner's insurer pays their contribution
- All insureds fully protected

### 3.5.6 Common Claim Disputes

**1. Causation Disputes:**
- Was loss caused by insured or excluded peril?
- Example: Was damage from storm (covered) or poor maintenance (excluded)?

**2. Seaworthiness:**
- Insurer claims ship was unseaworthy
- Loss due to unseaworthiness not covered
- Burden of proof on insurer

**3. Deviation:**
- Ship deviated from agreed route without justification
- May void coverage

**4. Valuation Disputes:**
- Disagreement on insurable value (unvalued policies)
- Requires detailed documentation

**5. General Average vs. Particular Average:**
- Dispute whether loss qualifies as GA
- Affects who pays

**Resolution Methods:**

1. **Negotiation:** Direct discussion between parties

## Chapter Summary

This chapter explored the specialized world of marine insurance:

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Marine Insurance Contracts** are unique agreements providing indemnity for losses related to marine adventures, governed by principles including insurable interest at time of loss, utmost good faith, indemnity, subrogation, and proximate cause.

2. **Types of Policies** serve different needs:
   - **Voyage policies:** Specific journeys
   - **Time policies:** Fixed periods
   - **Valued policies:** Pre-agreed values
   - **Floating policies:** Multiple shipments
   - Each type suited to particular trading patterns and risk profiles

3. **Marine Losses** follow complex classification:
   - **Total Loss:** Complete destruction or deprivation
     - **Actual:** Physically destroyed or irretrievably lost
     - **Constructive:** Economically unreasonable to recover (requires notice of abandonment)
   - **Partial Loss:** Incomplete damage
     - **Particular Average:** Loss borne by individual owner
     - **General Average:** Voluntary sacrifice shared by all parties

4. **Claims Settlement** involves specialized procedures, surveys, documentation, and often international coordination, with particular complexity for general average adjustments.

Understanding marine insurance is essential for international trade, as it enables the movement of goods across oceans by providing financial protection against the inherent perils of maritime commerce.

2. What are the three primary categories of subject matter in marine insurance? Give an example of each.

3. Explain why the principle of utmost good faith is particularly important in marine insurance compared to other insurance types.

4. When must insurable interest exist in marine insurance? How does this differ from life insurance and property insurance?

5. Compare and contrast voyage policies and time policies. When would each be most appropriate?

6. Explain the difference between valued and unvalued marine insurance policies. What are the advantages of each?

7. What is a floating policy (open cover)? How does it benefit regular exporters?

8. Define actual total loss and provide three situations that constitute an actual total loss.

9. What is constructive total loss? Why is notice of abandonment required for CTL but not for ATL?

## Case Studies for Analysis

### Case Study 1: Actual vs. Constructive Total Loss

**Scenario:**  
MV Prosperity, a cargo vessel insured for $12 million, is carrying electronics worth $8 million from Singapore to Chittagong. During a severe cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, the ship suffers catastrophic damage and begins sinking. The captain orders evacuation, and the ship sinks in 4,000 meters of water.

Meanwhile, MV Fortune, similarly insured for $12 million and carrying similar cargo, also suffers severe storm damage but remains afloat. It limps to the nearest port in India. Survey reveals:
- Hull damage repair cost: $7 million
- Engine replacement needed: $6 million
- Total repair cost: $13 million
- Salvage value of damaged ship: $2 million

**Questions:**
1. Analyze each vessel's situation. Which represents actual total loss and which represents constructive total loss?
2. For MV Prosperity, what documentation would be needed to process the claim?
3. For MV Fortune, what steps must the owner take to claim constructive total loss?
4. If the owner of MV Fortune fails to serve notice of abandonment, what are the consequences?
5. Calculate the net cost to insurers for each vessel scenario.

### Case Study 2: General Average or Particular Average?

**Scenario A:**  
Ship carrying mixed cargo encounters heavy weather. Containers on deck are washed overboard by a rogue wave. Among the lost containers are 50 containers belonging to XYZ Corporation worth $2 million.

**Scenario B:**  
Same ship, but this time the captain, fearing the ship will capsize due to instability in the storm, deliberately orders 50 containers (including all of XYZ Corporation's containers) thrown overboard to reduce weight and save the ship. The ship survives and reaches port with the remaining cargo intact.

**Questions:**
1. In Scenario A, is this particular average or general average? Explain your reasoning.
2. In Scenario B, is this particular average or general average? Explain your reasoning.
3. What are the key differences in how XYZ Corporation would be compensated in each scenario?
4. If Scenario B occurs, and the saved values are: ship ($20 million), remaining cargo ($15 million), freight ($1 million), calculate each party's contribution to compensate XYZ Corporation.
5. How would insurance coverage differ for XYZ Corporation between the two scenarios?

### Case Study 3: Multiple Policy Types

**Scenario:**  
Bangladesh Garments Ltd. (BGL) exports ready-made garments regularly to European buyers. They currently purchase a separate voyage policy for each shipment, paying approximately $8,000 per shipment in premiums. They ship 50 times per year, with average cargo value of $400,000 per shipment.

An insurance broker suggests two alternatives:
- **Option A:** Floating policy with aggregate limit of $25 million, rate 0.4%, declarations required within 24 hours of shipment
- **Option B:** Blanket policy covering all shipments automatically, estimated annual value $20 million, rate 0.45%, adjustment at year-end

**Questions:**
1. Calculate BGL's current annual insurance cost.
2. Calculate the estimated cost under Option A (floating policy).
3. Calculate the estimated cost under Option B (blanket policy).
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?
5. What would you recommend for BGL and why?
6. What risks does BGL face if they choose the floating policy but forget to declare a shipment?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Constructive Total Loss Calculation

A cargo ship valued at $18 million suffers damage from grounding. Survey estimates:
- Salvage and refloating costs: $4 million
- Hull repairs: $9 million
- Engine repairs: $5 million
- Other repairs: $2 million

Calculate:
1. Total cost to recover and repair
2. Whether this constitutes constructive total loss
3. Net cost to insurer if CTL claimed and wreck sold for $3 million salvage

### Exercise 2: General Average Contribution

A ship (value $25 million) carrying cargo from multiple owners (total cargo value $20 million) encounters fire. To save the ship, the captain floods a cargo hold, destroying cargo worth $4 million belonging to Company A. Freight at risk is $1 million. All other cargo and the ship are saved.

Calculate:
1. Total saved values
2. Company A's compensation amount
3. Shipowner's contribution
4. Total contribution from all other cargo owners
5. Freight owner's contribution

### Exercise 3: Particular Average Settlement

Cargo insured for $600,000 under Institute Cargo Clause A (all risks) suffers 35% damage from seawater during voyage. Salvage value of damaged portion is $80,000. Policy has $10,000 deductible.

Calculate:
1. Gross loss amount
2. Net loss after salvage
3. Claim payment after deductible
