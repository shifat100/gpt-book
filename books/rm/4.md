# SECTION A: FIRE INSURANCE

## 4.1 Introduction to Fire Insurance

**Fire Insurance** is a contract whereby the insurer, in consideration of the premium paid, undertakes to indemnify the insured against financial loss or damage caused by fire to specified property during a specified period.

### 4.1.1 Scope and Importance

**What Fire Insurance Covers:**

Fire insurance protects against:
- Direct loss or damage to property from fire
- Consequential losses (if specifically covered)
- Additional expenses incurred due to fire

**Property That Can Be Insured:**

- **Buildings:** Residential, commercial, industrial structures
- **Contents:** Furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery
- **Stock:** Inventory, raw materials, finished goods
- **Business Assets:** Office equipment, computers, documents

**Importance:**

1. **Property Protection:** Fire can destroy years of investment in minutes
2. **Business Continuity:** Enables businesses to recover and restart
3. **Loan Security:** Mortgagees require fire insurance on financed property
4. **Legal Compliance:** Some jurisdictions mandate fire insurance for certain properties
5. **Peace of Mind:** Psychological security for property owners

**Bangladesh Context:**

Fire is a significant risk in Bangladesh due to:
- High density housing in urban areas
- Wooden structures in rural areas
- Industrial concentration (garment factories, warehouses)
- Electrical infrastructure challenges
- Limited firefighting resources in some areas

Major fire incidents (Rana Plaza, Tazreen Fashions, various market fires) highlight the critical importance of fire insurance for:
- Factory owners
- Commercial establishments
- Residential property owners
- Warehouse operators

### 4.1.2 Fundamental Principle: Proximate Cause

Fire insurance covers loss where **fire is the proximate cause**.

**Covered Scenarios:**

1. **Fire as Direct Cause:**
   - Electrical short circuit → Fire → Building damaged
   - **Proximate Cause:** Fire (covered)

2. **Consequent Damage from Fire:**
   - Fire → Smoke damage to goods
   - Fire → Water damage from firefighting
   - **Proximate Cause:** Fire (covered)

3. **Damage While Removing Property:**
   - Fire breaks out → Goods damaged while being evacuated
   - **Proximate Cause:** Fire (covered)

**Excluded Scenarios:**

1. **Fire as Remote Cause:**
   - Earthquake → Gas leak → Fire (if earthquake excluded)
   - **Proximate Cause:** Earthquake (excluded)

2. **Fire as Consequence of Excluded Peril:**
   - War → Bomb → Fire
   - **Proximate Cause:** War (typically excluded)

3. **Spontaneous Combustion (Usually Excluded):**
   - Goods self-ignite due to inherent nature
   - **Proximate Cause:** Inherent vice (excluded)

## 4.2 The Fire Insurance Contract

### 4.2.1 Characteristics of Fire Insurance Contracts

Fire insurance contracts possess both general insurance characteristics and specific features unique to fire coverage.

#### **A. Contract of Indemnity**

Fire insurance aims to restore the insured to the same financial position as before the fire, but no better.

**Measure of Indemnity:**

For different property types:

| **Property Type** | **Measure of Indemnity** |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Buildings** | Cost to repair/rebuild (considering depreciation) OR Market value at time of loss |
| **Plant & Machinery** | Replacement cost less depreciation OR Actual cash value |
| **Stock-in-Trade** | Market value at time of loss OR Cost price plus reasonable profit |
| **Household Contents** | Replacement cost of similar items less depreciation |

**Example:**

*Building insured for $500,000. Fire destroys 40% of building. Repair cost: $180,000.*

**Claim Payment:** $180,000 (actual repair cost), not $200,000 (40% of sum insured).

**Average Clause (Co-Insurance):**

Most fire policies include an average clause to discourage under-insurance.

**Average Clause Formula:**
```
Claim Payment = (Sum Insured / Actual Value) × Loss Amount
```

**Example with Average Clause:**

*Factory building actual value: $1,000,000  
Sum insured: $600,000 (60% of value - under-insured)  
Fire loss: $300,000*

**Calculation:**
```
Claim = ($600,000 / $1,000,000) × $300,000
Claim = 0.60 × $300,000
Claim = $180,000
```

**Result:** Insured receives only $180,000, not the full $300,000 loss. The under-insurance penalty means the insured bears $120,000 of the loss.

**Lesson:** Always insure property for full value to avoid average clause penalties.

#### **B. Contract of Utmost Good Faith**

Both parties must disclose all material facts.

**Material Facts in Fire Insurance:**

**For the Insured to Disclose:**

1. **Property-Related:**
   - Construction type (brick, wood, concrete)
   - Age and condition of building
   - Previous fire losses or damage
   - Structural modifications
   - Fire safety equipment installed

2. **Occupancy-Related:**
   - How property is used
   - Hazardous materials stored
   - Number of occupants
   - Operating hours

3. **Location-Related:**
   - Proximity to fire station
   - Neighboring properties (especially hazardous)
   - Access for fire engines
   - Water supply availability

4. **Other Insurance:**
   - Existence of other fire policies on same property
   - Previous policy cancellations or denials

**Example of Material Non-Disclosure:**

*Scenario:* Factory owner applies for fire insurance without disclosing that the factory stores large quantities of flammable chemicals in violation of safety regulations.

*Result:* If fire occurs and non-disclosure discovered, insurer may void the policy and deny the claim entirely, even if the chemicals didn't cause the fire.

**For the Insurer:**

- Must explain policy terms clearly
- Disclose exclusions and limitations
- Provide accurate information about coverage

#### **C. Insurable Interest**

The insured must have an insurable interest in the property at the time of loss.

**Unlike marine insurance:** Fire insurance requires insurable interest at:
- Time of policy inception AND
- Time of loss

**Who Has Insurable Interest:**

| **Party** | **Insurable Interest** | **Extent** |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Property Owner** | Full ownership interest | Full value of property |
| **Mortgagee (Lender)** | Security for loan | Amount of outstanding mortgage |
| **Tenant** | Leasehold interest | Value of lease + own contents |
| **Bailee** | Goods held for others | Value of goods in custody |
| **Business Partner** | Partnership property | Share of property value |
| **Life Tenant** | Property held for lifetime | Value during their lifetime |

**Example:**

*Mr. Rahman owns a building worth $800,000 with a $500,000 mortgage from ABC Bank.*

**Insurable Interests:**
- **Mr. Rahman:** $800,000 (full value as owner)
- **ABC Bank:** $500,000 (extent of secured loan)

**Both can insure their respective interests.**

**Loss of Insurable Interest:**

If insurable interest ceases, coverage terminates.

**Example:**

*Ms. Akter insures rented warehouse. Lease expires. She no longer has insurable interest. Insurance coverage ends even if policy period hasn't expired.*

#### **D. Principle of Subrogation**

After paying a claim, the insurer acquires the insured's rights to recover from third parties responsible for the fire.

**Common Subrogation Scenarios:**

1. **Negligence of Third Party:**
   - Neighbor's negligence causes fire that spreads
   - Contractor's faulty electrical work causes fire
   - Tenant's negligence damages landlord's property

2. **Product Liability:**
   - Defective appliance causes fire
   - Faulty wiring from manufacturer

**Example:**

*Scenario:* An electrical appliance manufactured by Company X catches fire due to defective wiring, destroying Mr. Hasan's shop. His fire insurer pays $200,000 claim.

*Subrogation:* The insurer now has the right to sue Company X (the manufacturer) for $200,000 to recover the claim payment.

*Outcome:* If successful, insurer recovers its payment from the responsible party.

**Waiver of Subrogation:**

Insureds must not compromise the insurer's subrogation rights.

**Prohibited Actions:**
- Releasing the responsible party from liability
- Settling with them without insurer's consent
- Signing agreements waiving right to sue

**Consequence of Violation:** Insurer may reduce claim payment by the amount that could have been recovered through subrogation.

#### **E. Principle of Contribution**

When the same property is insured with multiple insurers, each contributes proportionally.

**Example:**

*Building worth $1,000,000 insured with three insurers:*
- Insurer A: $500,000
- Insurer B: $300,000
- Insurer C: $200,000
- **Total Coverage:** $1,000,000

*Fire causes $400,000 damage.*

**Contribution Calculation:**

**Insurer A:** ($500,000 / $1,000,000) × $400,000 = $200,000  
**Insurer B:** ($300,000 / $1,000,000) × $400,000 = $120,000  
**Insurer C:** ($200,000 / $1,000,000) × $400,000 = $80,000  
**Total:** $400,000

Each insurer pays their proportionate share.

#### **F. Annual Contract**

Fire insurance policies are typically issued for one year and must be renewed annually.

**Characteristics:**

- **Fixed Period:** Usually 12 months
- **Renewal Required:** Must be renewed to continue coverage
- **Premium Paid:** Usually annually in advance
- **Cancellation:** Either party can cancel with notice

**Renewal Process:**

1. **Insurer Reminder:** Typically sent 30-60 days before expiry
2. **Premium Reassessment:** May change based on claims history, property changes
3. **Policy Review:** Update sum insured for inflation, property improvements
4. **Payment:** Premium paid for renewal period
5. **New Policy Issued:** Coverage continues without interruption

**Grace Period:**

Some insurers provide a grace period (typically 15-30 days) after expiry during which coverage continues if renewal payment is in process.

**Importance of Timely Renewal:**

**Example:**

*Policy expires December 31. Fire occurs January 5. Premium not yet paid for renewal.*

**Without Grace Period:** No coverage; entire loss borne by property owner.  
**With Grace Period (30 days):** Coverage continues until January 30; claim paid.

**Lesson:** Never allow policies to lapse; renew before expiry.

### 4.2.2 Standard Exclusions in Fire Insurance

**Without Business Interruption Insurance:**
- Lost profit: $50,000 × 8 = $400,000
- Continuing fixed costs: $20,000 × 8 = $160,000
- **Total uninsured loss: $560,000**

**With Business Interruption Insurance:**
- Fire damage to building: Paid by fire policy
- Lost profit + fixed costs: Paid by business interruption policy
- **Business recovers fully**

#### **C. Consequential Loss Following Fire (CLOF)**

Simpler version covering only profit loss following fire, typically for smaller businesses.

### 4.3.5 Claim Calculation Examples

**Example 1: No Under-Insurance**

*Building actual value: $800,000  
Sum insured: $800,000  
Fire damage: $320,000  
Deductible: $10,000*

**Calculation:**
```
Full value insured (no average clause penalty)
Gross claim: $320,000
Less deductible: $10,000
Net claim payment: $310,000
```

**Example 2: Under-Insurance with Average Clause**

*Building actual value: $1,000,000  
Sum insured: $600,000 (60% of value)  
Fire damage: $400,000  
Deductible: $10,000*

**Calculation:**
```
Average clause applies:
Claim = (Sum Insured / Actual Value) × Loss
Claim = ($600,000 / $1,000,000) × $400,000
Claim = 0.60 × $400,000
Claim = $240,000

Less deductible: $10,000
Net claim payment: $230,000

Insured bears: $400,000 - $230,000 = $170,000
```

**Example 3: Total Loss**

*Building actual value: $500,000  
Sum insured: $500,000  
Complete destruction by fire  
Salvage value (land + debris): $100,000*

**Calculation:**
```
Total loss claim: $500,000
Less salvage value: $100,000
Net claim: $400,000

Note: Insured retains salvage (land + debris worth $100,000)
Total recovery: $500,000 (claim + salvage)
```

**Example 4: Partial Loss with Salvage**

*Stock insured: $200,000  
Fire damages 60% of stock completely  
Remaining 40% undamaged  
Damaged stock salvage value: $20,000  
Deductible: $5,000*

**Calculation:**
```
Total loss: 60% × $200,000 = $120,000
Less salvage: $20,000
Net loss: $100,000
Less deductible: $5,000
Net claim payment: $95,000

Insured retains:
- Undamaged stock worth: $80,000
- Salvage worth: $20,000
Total: $100,000 + claim $95,000 = $195,000
Original value: $200,000
Net loss to insured: $5,000 (deductible)
```

### 4.3.6 Claim Disputes and Delays

**Common Reasons for Claim Denial/Dispute:**

**1. Arson (Intentional Fire):**
- Insured deliberately set fire
- Most serious cause for denial
- Requires investigation and proof

**2. Material Non-Disclosure:**
- Failure to disclose hazardous materials
- Occupancy change not reported
- Previous fire history concealed

**3. Breach of Warranty:**
- Security requirements not met
- Fire safety equipment not maintained
- Unauthorized structural changes

**4. Excluded Peril:**
- Fire caused by earthquake (excluded)
- War-related fire
- Spontaneous combustion

**5. No Insurable Interest:**
- Insured sold property before fire
- Lease expired

**6. Policy Lapsed:**
- Premium not paid
- Coverage expired

**7. Fraudulent Claim:**
- Inflated loss amounts
- False documentation
- Claiming for non-existent property

**Resolution Process:**

**Step 1: Internal Review**
- Request reconsideration from insurer
- Provide additional evidence
- Clarify misunderstandings

**Step 2: Independent Assessment**
- Hire own loss assessor
- Get independent expert opinions
- Challenge insurer's survey

**Step 3: Regulatory Complaint**
- File complaint with insurance regulatory authority
- Regulator may mediate

**Step 4: Arbitration**
- Most policies include arbitration clause
- Binding decision by arbitrator
- Faster than litigation

**Step 5: Litigation**
- File lawsuit in appropriate court
- Last resort
- Expensive and time-consuming

## 4.4 Reinsurance

### 4.4.1 Definition and Concept

**Reinsurance** is insurance for insurance companies. It is a contract whereby one insurer (the reinsurer) agrees to indemnify another insurer (the ceding company or cedant) for all or part of the risk underwritten by the cedant.

**Simple Analogy:**

Just as individuals buy insurance to protect against losses, insurance companies buy insurance (reinsurance) to protect themselves against large claims that could threaten their financial stability.

**Parties to Reinsurance:**

1. **Ceding Company (Cedant):** The original insurer who transfers risk
2. **Reinsurer:** The company accepting the transferred risk
3. **Retrocedant:** Reinsurer who further transfers risk to another reinsurer (retrocession)

**Example:**

*ABC Insurance Company (ceding company) issues a $10 million fire policy on a large factory. ABC wants to limit its exposure to $2 million, so it reinsures $8 million with XYZ Reinsurance Company (reinsurer).*

**If fire loss of $10 million occurs:**
- ABC pays the full $10 million to the insured (policyholder)
- XYZ Reinsurance reimburses ABC for $8 million
- **ABC's net cost: $2 million (its retained portion)**

### 4.4.2 Why Insurance Companies Use Reinsurance

**Primary Reasons:**

#### **A. Capacity Enhancement**

Allows insurers to accept larger risks than they could retain alone.

**Example:**

*Small insurance company with capital of $50 million wants to insure a $100 million industrial complex. Without reinsurance, this would be too risky. With reinsurance:*
- Retain $10 million
- Reinsure $90 million
- Can compete for large clients

**Benefit:** Enables smaller insurers to compete with larger ones for big accounts.

#### **B. Stability and Solvency Protection**

Protects against catastrophic losses that could bankrupt the insurer.

**Example:**

*Major fire destroys multiple buildings in commercial district. Insurer has 50 policies averaging $2 million each in the affected area.*

**Potential loss:** $100 million

**Without reinsurance:** Could wipe out insurer's capital  
**With catastrophe reinsurance:** Reinsurer pays majority of loss; insurer remains solvent

**Benefit:** Ensures company can survive major catastrophes.

#### **C. Surplus Relief**

Helps manage capital requirements and regulatory ratios.

**Regulatory Requirement:** Insurers must maintain minimum capital ratios relative to premiums written.

**Problem:** Writing new policies requires setting aside capital reserves.

**Solution:** Reinsurance reduces net exposure, freeing up capital for growth.

**Example:**

*Insurer must hold $1 in capital for every $3 in premiums. Company has $300 million capital, limiting premiums to $900 million.*

**With Reinsurance:** Reinsure 50% of portfolio:
- Gross premiums: $900 million
- Net retained: $450 million
- Required capital: $150 million
- Freed capital: $150 million (can write $450 million more business)

#### **D. Catastrophe Protection**

Specialized coverage for events affecting multiple policies simultaneously.

**Catastrophic Events:**
- Major earthquakes
- Hurricanes, cyclones
- Large-scale fires (industrial areas, markets)
- Floods affecting wide areas
- Terrorist attacks

**Example:**

*Cyclone damages thousands of properties. Insurer has 5,000 policies in affected area averaging $100,000 each.*

**Total exposure:** $500 million

**Catastrophe Reinsurance Structure:**
- Insurer retains first $50 million
- Reinsurer pays $450 million
- **Insurer's maximum loss: $50 million (manageable)**

#### **E. Expertise and Advice**

Reinsurers provide valuable services:
- Underwriting guidance
- Actuarial expertise
- Risk assessment
- Claims handling advice
- Industry best practices

**Benefit:** Especially valuable for smaller or newer insurers.

#### **F. Profit Smoothing**

Reduces volatility in annual results.

**Without Reinsurance:** Large claim one year creates huge loss; next year no claims creates huge profit—volatile results.

**With Reinsurance:** Extreme results moderated; steadier year-to-year performance.

**Benefit:** Satisfies shareholders and regulators who prefer stable performance.

#### **G. Portfolio Balancing**

Helps manage concentration of risks.

**Problem:** Too many policies in one geographic area or industry creates dangerous concentration.

**Solution:** Reinsure excess concentration to diversify risk.

**Example:**

*Insurer has 60% of fire policies in Dhaka, creating geographic concentration. Reinsures portion of Dhaka exposure while retaining more of diversified rural portfolio.*

### 4.4.3 Types of Reinsurance

Reinsurance can be classified by arrangement method and coverage structure.

#### **Classification by Arrangement: Treaty vs. Facultative**

### **A. Treaty Reinsurance (Automatic)**

**Definition:** A standing agreement where the reinsurer agrees to automatically accept a defined portion of all risks in a specified class written by the ceding company.

**Characteristics:**

- **Automatic Coverage:** No case-by-case approval needed
- **Obligatory:** Reinsurer must accept all risks meeting treaty terms
- **Ongoing Agreement:** Covers all eligible policies during treaty period
- **Portfolio-Based:** Applies to classes of business, not individual risks
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Minimal paperwork per policy

**How It Works:**

1. **Agreement Established:**
   - Ceding company and reinsurer negotiate treaty terms
   - Define covered classes (e.g., all fire risks up to $5 million)
   - Specify retention and cession percentages
   - Set premium rates
   - Agree on claims handling

2. **Automatic Operation:**
   - When ceding company writes eligible policy, reinsurance automatically applies
   - No need to submit each risk for approval
   - Reinsurer trusts ceding company's underwriting

3. **Regular Reporting:**
   - Monthly or quarterly reports of covered policies
   - Premium payments to reinsurer
   - Claims notifications

**Example:**

*ABC Insurance and XYZ Reinsurance establish treaty:*
- **Covered:** All fire risks on commercial buildings
- **ABC Retention:** 25% of each risk
- **XYZ Cession:** 75% of each risk
- **Maximum per risk:** $10 million
- **Term:** 3 years

**Operation:**

**Policy 1:** $4 million factory fire insurance  
- ABC retains: $1 million (25%)
- XYZ automatically reinsures: $3 million (75%)

**Policy 2:** $8 million warehouse fire insurance  
- ABC retains: $2 million (25%)  
- XYZ automatically reinsures: $6 million (75%)

**No individual approval needed for either policy—automatic under treaty.**

**Advantages of Treaty Reinsurance:**

✓ **Administrative Efficiency:** Minimal paperwork per policy  
✓ **Speed:** Instant coverage without approval delays  
✓ **Certainty:** Known reinsurance structure upfront  
✓ **Cost-Effective:** Lower administration costs  
✓ **Relationship-Based:** Builds long-term partnerships  
✓ **Capacity Planning:** Known capacity for underwriting

**Disadvantages:**

✗ **Less Flexibility:** Cannot selectively reinsure only bad risks  
✗ **Quality Dependence:** Reinsurer depends on ceding company's underwriting quality  
✗ **Obligatory Acceptance:** Reinsurer must accept all eligible risks (good and bad)  
✗ **Portfolio Risk:** Reinsurer exposed to entire portfolio characteristics

**When Used:**

- For routine, homogeneous risks
- Standard policies within insurer's normal appetite
- When volume of transactions is high
- For smaller to medium-sized risks
- When efficiency is priority

### **B. Facultative Reinsurance (Optional)**

**Definition:** Reinsurance arranged on a case-by-case basis, where both parties have the faculty (option) to negotiate terms for each individual risk.

**Characteristics:**

- **Individual Negotiation:** Each risk separately proposed and accepted
- **Optional:** Reinsurer can accept or decline each risk
- **Specific Terms:** Negotiated for each placement
- **Detailed Review:** Reinsurer underwrites each risk independently
- **Flexible Structure:** Terms vary by risk characteristics

**How It Works:**

1. **Risk Submission:**
   - Ceding company identifies risk needing facultative reinsurance
   - Prepares detailed submission (risk details, survey reports, exposure analysis)
   - Submits to one or more reinsurers

2. **Underwriting:**
   - Reinsurer reviews submission thoroughly
   - May request additional information
   - Assesses risk independently - Decides whether to accept

3. **Negotiation:**
   - If interested, reinsurer quotes terms (rate, conditions, share)
   - Ceding company may negotiate or approach other reinsurers
   - May place risk with multiple reinsurers (co-reinsurance)

4. **Acceptance:**
   - Once terms agreed, facultative certificate issued
   - Coverage specific to this risk only

**Example:**

*ABC Insurance is approached to insure a $50 million petrochemical plant. This exceeds ABC's treaty capacity and is a specialized risk.*

**Facultative Process:**

**Step 1:** ABC prepares detailed submission:
- Full plant description
- Risk engineering survey
- Fire protection systems
- Exposure analysis
- Claims history

**Step 2:** ABC approaches reinsurers:
- Submits to 5 specialized reinsurers
- Each evaluates independently

**Step 3:** Reinsurers respond:
- Reinsurer A: Accepts $10 million at 0.3% rate
- Reinsurer B: Accepts $15 million at 0.35% rate
- Reinsurer C: Declines (outside appetite)
- Reinsurer D: Accepts $5 million at 0.4% rate
- Reinsurer E: Accepts $10 million at 0.3% rate

**Step 4:** ABC structures coverage:
- ABC retains: $10 million
- Reinsurance placed: $40 million (with 4 reinsurers)
- **Total coverage: $50 million**

Each reinsurer issued separate facultative certificate for their portion.

**Advantages of Facultative Reinsurance:**

✓ **Flexibility:** Can reinsure selected risks only  
✓ **Large/Unusual Risks:** Suitable for non-standard exposures  
✓ **Expertise Access:** Specialized reinsurers for specific risk types  
✓ **No Obligatory Acceptance:** Reinsurer selects risks to accept  
✓ **Customized Terms:** Tailored to specific risk characteristics  
✓ **Risk-Specific Pricing:** Rate reflects individual risk quality

**Disadvantages:**

✗ **Time-Consuming:** Requires individual negotiation for each risk  
✗ **Administrative Burden:** Significant paperwork and documentation  
✗ **Uncertainty:** Coverage not guaranteed until accepted  
✗ **Higher Costs:** More expensive due to individual underwriting  
✗ **Delay:** May delay policy issuance while awaiting reinsurer response

**When Used:**

- For large, unusual, or specialized risks
- When risk exceeds treaty capacity
- For risks outside treaty scope
- For substandard or hazardous exposures
- When specific expertise needed
- For one-off or infrequent exposures

### **Comparison: Treaty vs. Facultative**

| **Aspect** | **Treaty Reinsurance** | **Facultative Reinsurance** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Application** | Automatic for all eligible risks | Case-by-case for specific risks |
| **Approval** | No individual approval needed | Individual approval required |
| **Obligation** | Reinsurer must accept all eligible | Reinsurer can accept or decline each |
| **Administration** | Minimal per-policy paperwork | Extensive documentation per risk |
| **Speed** | Immediate coverage | Delayed pending acceptance |
| **Cost** | Lower administrative costs | Higher administrative costs |
| **Flexibility** | Limited flexibility | High flexibility |
| **Usage** | Routine, homogeneous risks | Large, unusual, specialized risks |
| **Volume** | High volume of small/medium risks | Low volume of large/complex risks |
| **Relationship** | Long-term partnership | Transaction-based |

### **Combined Approach:**

Most insurers use **both** treaty and facultative reinsurance:

**Example Structure:**

*Fire Insurance Company has:*

**Treaty Reinsurance:**
- Covers all standard fire risks up to $5 million
- Company retains 20%, reinsures 80%
- Handles 95% of business automatically

**Facultative Reinsurance:**
- Used for risks exceeding $5 million
- Used for specialized risks (petrochemical plants, high-value art galleries)
- Used when extra capacity needed beyond treaty limits

**Benefit:** Efficiency of treaty for standard business + flexibility of facultative for special cases.

#### **Classification by Coverage Structure:**

### **Proportional vs. Non-Proportional Reinsurance**

While less emphasized in basic courses, it's worth understanding these structures briefly:

**Proportional (Quota Share, Surplus):**
- Premiums and losses shared in fixed proportions
- Example: 75% ceded means 75% of premium goes to reinsurer, who pays 75% of every claim

**Non-Proportional (Excess of Loss):**
- Reinsurer pays only when loss exceeds specified threshold
- Example: Insurer retains first $1 million of any claim; reinsurer pays excess
- Common for catastrophe protection

**No Individual Underwriting (for large groups):**

Standard group sizes covered without medical examinations:
- Insurer relies on group demographics
- Average age and risk profile assessed

### 4.9.3 Key Concepts in Motor Insurance

#### **A. Insured Declared Value (IDV)**

**Definition:** The current market value of the vehicle agreed between insured and insurer at policy inception.

**Calculation:**
```
IDV = Manufacturer's Listed Selling Price - Depreciation
```

**Or:** Current market value based on age and condition.

**Importance:**
- **Sum Insured:** Maximum amount payable for total loss/theft
- **Premium Basis:** Premium calculated as percentage of IDV
- **Claim Limit:** Cannot exceed IDV

**Depreciation Schedule (Typical):**

| **Vehicle Age** | **Depreciation** |
|----------------|------------------|
| Up to 6 months | 5% |
| 6 months - 1 year | 15% |
| 1-2 years | 20% |
| 2-3 years | 30% |
| 3-4 years | 40% |
| 4-5 years | 50% |
| Above 5 years | By mutual agreement |

**Example:**

*Car purchased new for $25,000, now 2 years old.*

**IDV Calculation:**
- Listed price: $25,000
- Depreciation (2 years): 30%
- **IDV = $25,000 × (1 - 0.30) = $17,500**

**Impact on Claim:**

If car is totally damaged or stolen:
- **Maximum claim payment: $17,500** (IDV)
- Not the original $25,000

#### **B. Deductible (Excess)**

**Definition:** Amount insured must pay first before insurer pays remaining claim.

**Types:**

**Compulsory Deductible:**
- Mandated by regulations
- Varies by vehicle type and engine capacity
- Example: $500 for cars, $200 for motorcycles

**Voluntary Deductible:**
- Optionally chosen by insured for premium discount
- Higher deductible = lower premium
- Example: Choose $1,000 deductible for 10% premium discount

**Example:**

*Accident damage: $3,000  
Compulsory deductible: $500  
Voluntary deductible: $500  
Total deductible: $1,000*

**Claim Payment:**
- Total loss: $3,000
- Less deductible: $1,000
- **Insurer pays: $2,000**
- **Insured bears: $1,000**

**Strategy:** Higher deductible appropriate for:
- Careful drivers (fewer small claims)
- Those able to absorb small losses
- Premium savings desired

#### **C. No Claim Bonus (NCB)**

**Definition:** Discount on renewal premium for not making any claim during preceding policy period.

**Purpose:** Rewards claim-free driving.

**Typical NCB Scale:**

| **Claim-Free Years** | **NCB Discount** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 year | 20% |
| 2 years | 25% |
| 3 years | 35% |
| 4 years | 45% |
| 5+ years | 50% |

**How It Works:**

**Year 1:** Premium $1,000, no claim  
**Year 2:** Premium $1,000 - 20% NCB = $800, no claim  
**Year 3:** Premium $1,000 - 25% NCB = $750, no claim  
**Year 4:** Premium $1,000 - 35% NCB = $650

**If Claim Made:**

NCB typically lost or reduced:
- One claim: NCB reduced or eliminated
- Multiple claims: NCB reset to zero

**Example:**

*Year 5 NCB: 50% ($500 discount)  
Makes one claim  
Year 6: NCB reduced to 20% or 0% (depending on insurer policy)*

**Strategy:**
- Consider not claiming for very small damages
- Preserve NCB for significant savings
- Cost-benefit analysis: Repair cost vs. NCB loss

**NCB Protection:**

Some insurers offer NCB protection rider:
- Pay additional premium
- NCB preserved even after one claim per year
- Worthwhile for high NCB holders

#### **D. Constructive Total Loss (Write-Off)**

**Definition:** Vehicle so damaged that repair cost exceeds certain percentage of IDV (typically 75-80%), making economic repair unreasonable.

**Insurer's Options:**

1. **Declare Total Loss:**
   - Pay IDV to insured
   - Take possession of damaged vehicle
   - Sell as salvage

2. **Repair:**
   - Uncommon if truly CTL
   - Only if owner insists and accepts limitations

**Example:**

*Car IDV: $10,000  
Accident damage repair estimate: $8,500  
Threshold: 75% of IDV = $7,500*

**Analysis:**
- Repair cost ($8,500) > Threshold ($7,500)
- **Declared Constructive Total Loss**

**Settlement:**
- Insurer pays $10,000 (IDV)
- Takes possession of damaged car
- Sells salvage for $2,000
- **Insurer's net cost: $8,000**

## Case Studies for Analysis

### Case Study 1: Fire Insurance Claim Dispute

**Scenario:**  
Mr. Ahmed owns a textile factory in Gazipur. The building's actual replacement value is $2,000,000, but to save on premiums, he insured it for only $1,200,000. The policy includes an average clause.

A fire breaks out due to an electrical short circuit, causing $800,000 in damage to the building. Additionally:
- $50,000 was spent on firefighting efforts to save the undamaged portion
- $30,000 was spent on temporary fencing and security to prevent theft
- $120,000 worth of machinery was damaged (separately insured for full value)
- The factory was closed for 4 months for repairs, losing $200,000 in profits

Mr. Ahmed submits a comprehensive claim including all these amounts totaling $1,200,000.

**Questions:**
1. Calculate the claim payment for building damage considering the average clause.
2. Which of the additional expenses (firefighting, security, lost profits) would typically be covered under a standard fire policy?
3. How would the machinery damage claim be handled?
4. What type of additional insurance should Mr. Ahmed have purchased to cover lost profits?
5. What lessons can be learned about proper insurance coverage?

### Case Study 2: Reinsurance Structure

**Scenario:**  
Dhaka Insurance Company (DIC) is a medium-sized insurer with capital of $80 million. They typically write fire insurance policies ranging from $100,000 to $5 million. However, they've been approached by a large corporation wanting to insure:
- Corporate headquarters building: $50 million
- Manufacturing plant: $80 million  
- Warehouses (5 locations): $30 million total
- Total coverage needed: $160 million

DIC's management wants this business but is concerned about the concentration of risk. Their largest previous policy was $10 million.

**Questions:**
1. Without reinsurance, should DIC accept this risk? Why or why not?
2. Design a reinsurance structure using both treaty and facultative reinsurance that would enable DIC to accept this business safely.
3. If the corporate headquarters building suffers a $40 million fire loss, explain how the claim would be distributed between DIC and reinsurers under your proposed structure.
4. What are the benefits to DIC of using reinsurance in this situation?
5. How does this reinsurance arrangement benefit the client (corporate policyholder)?

### Case Study 3: Motor Insurance Comparison

**Scenario:**  
Ms. Sultana is purchasing a new car worth $25,000. She's considering three insurance options:

**Option A - Act Only (Third-Party Liability Only):**
- Annual Premium: $300
- Coverage: Third-party liability only

**Option B - Third-Party, Fire and Theft:**
- Annual Premium: $600
- Coverage: Third-party liability + fire + theft

**Option C - Comprehensive:**
- Annual Premium: $1,200
- Coverage: All risks including own damage
- Personal accident cover: $15,000
- Deductible: $500
- No previous NCB

**Three Scenarios to Consider:**

**Scenario 1 (Year 1):** Ms. Sultana causes an accident damaging another car ($8,000) and injuring the driver ($25,000 medical expenses). Her own car suffers $6,000 damage.

**Scenario 2 (Year 1):** Her car is stolen and not recovered (market value $24,000).

**Scenario 3 (Year 1):** No claims throughout the year.

**Questions:**
1. For each scenario, calculate what Ms. Sultana would receive/pay under each insurance option.
2. Create a cost-benefit analysis table comparing all three options across the three scenarios.
3. If Ms. Sultana is a careful driver with a clean record, which option would you recommend and why?
4. How would the analysis change if this were a 5-year-old car worth $12,000 instead?
5. In Scenario 3 (no claims), what would be the Year 2 premium under Option C if she receives a 20% NCB?
