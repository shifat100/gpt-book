## 6.1 Present Pattern of Insurance Business in Bangladesh

### 6.1.1 Historical Evolution

#### **Pre-Independence Era (Before 1971)**

The insurance industry in Bangladesh has roots dating back to the British colonial period:

- **Early Development:** Insurance business began during British rule, primarily serving British commercial interests
- **Foreign Dominance:** International insurance companies dominated the market
- **Limited Reach:** Insurance was largely confined to urban areas and commercial enterprises
- **Post-1947:** After the partition of India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had limited insurance infrastructure

#### **Nationalization Period (1972-1984)**

Following independence, the Government of Bangladesh took decisive action to restructure the insurance sector:

**Presidential Order No. 95 (1972):**
- Nationalized all insurance companies operating in Bangladesh
- Created two state monopolies:
  - **Jiban Bima Corporation (JBC):** For life insurance business
  - **Sadharan Bima Corporation (SBC):** For general (non-life) insurance business
- Objective: Mobilize resources for national development and ensure insurance accessibility

**Rationale for Nationalization:**
- Protect national interests
- Prevent capital flight
- Expand insurance coverage to rural areas
- Mobilize domestic savings for economic development
- Ensure affordable insurance for common people

#### **Liberalization Era (1984-Present)**

The insurance sector underwent gradual liberalization:

**1984:** Private sector re-entry permitted through Insurance Corporation (Amendment) Act
- Private companies allowed to operate alongside state corporations
- Strict regulatory oversight maintained
- Initial slow growth due to limited awareness and capacity

**2000s-Present:** Rapid expansion and modernization
- Significant increase in private insurance companies
- Introduction of modern insurance products
- Technology adoption and digital transformation

- Foreign investment allowed under certain conditions

### 6.3.5 Reinsurance Operations

SBC's reinsurance function is critical to Bangladesh's insurance market stability:

#### **Types of Reinsurance Provided:**

**1. Treaty Reinsurance**

**Definition:** Automatic reinsurance arrangement covering specified classes of business.

**SBC's Treaty Portfolio:**
- **Proportional Treaties:** Quota share and surplus treaties where SBC shares premiums and claims proportionally
- **Non-Proportional Treaties:** Excess of loss treaties where SBC covers claims exceeding specified retention

**Example:** SBC has a 20% quota share treaty with a private fire insurer. For every fire policy written, the insurer cedes 20% premium to SBC and SBC pays 20% of all claims.

**2. Facultative Reinsurance**

**Definition:** Case-by-case reinsurance for specific large risks.

**Application:**
- Mega industrial projects
- Large marine shipments
- Unusual or catastrophic exposures
- Risks exceeding treaty capacity

**Example:** A BDT 5 billion petrochemical plant fire insurance policy exceeds normal treaty capacity. The primary insurer requests facultative reinsurance from SBC for a portion of the risk.

#### **Reinsurance Structure:**

```
ORIGINAL INSURER (Primary Insurance Company)
            ↓
        [Risk Transfer]
            ↓
SADHARAN BIMA CORPORATION (National Reinsurer)
            ↓
        [Retrocession]
            ↓
INTERNATIONAL REINSURERS (Munich Re, Swiss Re, Lloyd's, etc.)
```

**Retrocession:** SBC retrocedes (transfers) portions of its reinsurance portfolio to international reinsurers to manage its own capacity and catastrophic exposure.

#### **Reinsurance Benefits to Market:**

**For Primary Insurers:**
- Increased underwriting capacity
- Catastrophic risk protection
- Capital relief
- Technical expertise and support

**For Insurance Market:**
- Market stability
- Capacity for large risks

## Chapter Summary

The insurance business in Bangladesh has evolved dramatically from its post-independence nationalization to the current competitive market structure. This chapter has explored the key dimensions of the Bangladeshi insurance landscape:

**Key Insights:**

1. **Dual Structure:** Bangladesh's insurance market operates through a unique combination of state-owned corporations (JBC and SBC) and a vibrant private sector, creating a competitive yet inclusive market.

2. **Public Sector Legacy:** Jiban Bima Corporation and Sadharan Bima Corporation continue to play crucial roles, particularly in rural insurance penetration and as the national reinsurer, though facing competitive pressures from private players.

3. **Private Sector Dynamism:** The entry and growth of private insurance companies have brought innovation, competition, customer service excellence, and technology adoption, though challenges of fragmentation and sustainability persist.

4. **Foreign Participation:** Companies like MetLife have contributed international best practices, product innovation, and professional standards, raising the overall industry bar.

5. **Market Development Stage:** Despite growth, Bangladesh's insurance penetration (0.5-0.7% of GDP) and density (USD 5-8 per capita) remain low by regional and global standards, indicating substantial untapped potential.

6. **Regulatory Maturation:** IDRA's establishment and evolving regulations are gradually strengthening market oversight, consumer protection, and industry standards.

**Critical Success Factors for Future:**

The sustainable development of Bangladesh's insurance sector depends on:
- **Awareness Building:** Increasing public understanding of insurance benefits
- **Product Innovation:** Developing relevant, affordable products for diverse segments
- **Distribution Optimization:** Leveraging technology and multi-channel strategies
- **Financial Strength:** Ensuring adequate capitalization and prudent risk management
- **Service Excellence:** Delivering superior customer experience and claims handling
- **Regulatory Support:** Creating conducive environment while protecting consumer interests
- **Market Consolidation:** Achieving sustainable scale through organic growth or mergers

**Looking Ahead:**

As Bangladesh progresses toward upper-middle-income status by 2030, the insurance sector stands at the cusp of significant transformation. The convergence of economic growth, demographic dividend, technological advancement, and regulatory maturity creates unprecedented opportunities. However, realizing this potential requires addressing structural challenges, enhancing financial inclusion, and building trust through consistent delivery of promises.

The insurance industry's success will be measured not just by premium growth but by its contribution to financial security, risk management, and economic resilience for all segments of Bangladeshi society.
