# Chapter 7: Marketing of Insurance Products

## Introduction

Marketing insurance products presents unique challenges that distinguish it from marketing tangible goods or even other financial services. An insurance policy cannot be seen, touched, or experienced before purchase. Its value is realized only when a loss occurs—an event the customer hopes will never happen. This paradox—selling protection against uncertain future events that people prefer not to think about—makes insurance marketing one of the most complex and challenging fields in business.

In Bangladesh, where insurance awareness remains relatively low and trust in the industry is still developing, effective marketing becomes even more critical. Insurance companies must not only sell policies but also educate customers, build trust, overcome cultural barriers, and change perceptions about risk and financial planning.

This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of insurance marketing, examines how the traditional and expanded marketing mix applies to insurance products, analyzes various distribution channels, and discusses the unique challenges facing insurance marketers in Bangladesh and globally.

Understanding insurance marketing is essential for anyone aspiring to work in the insurance industry, as it directly impacts an organization's ability to attract customers, generate revenue, and fulfill its risk management mission in society.

## 7.1 The Concept of Insurance Marketing

### 7.1.1 What is Marketing?

**Marketing** is the process of identifying, anticipating, and satisfying customer needs and wants profitably through the creation, communication, and delivery of value.

**Traditional Definition (American Marketing Association):**
> "Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."

**Applied to Insurance:**
Insurance marketing involves understanding people's risk management needs, designing appropriate insurance solutions, communicating their value, making them accessible through distribution channels, and building long-term relationships based on trust and service excellence.

---

### 7.1.2 Why Insurance Marketing is Different

Insurance products possess unique characteristics that fundamentally differentiate their marketing from physical goods:

#### **1. Intangibility**

**Definition:** Insurance is an intangible service—it cannot be seen, touched, tasted, heard, or smelled before purchase.

**Characteristics:**
- No physical form or substance
- Cannot be displayed in showrooms
- Difficult to demonstrate or sample
- Value is abstract and future-oriented
- Quality assessment is challenging before purchase

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** Customers cannot physically examine or experience insurance before buying, creating uncertainty and hesitation.

**Marketing Solutions:**
- **Tangibilize the intangible:** Use physical representations
  - Policy documents with professional design
  - Welcome kits and membership cards
  - Branded materials and certificates
  - Office environments that inspire confidence

- **Use vivid communication:** Make benefits concrete
  - Real customer testimonial videos
  - Before-and-after claim stories
  - Visual representations of protection
  - Scenarios and case studies

- **Leverage brand and reputation:**
  - Build strong brand identity
  - Emphasize financial strength
  - Showcase awards and recognition
  - Highlight longevity and stability

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

A general insurance company marketing fire insurance cannot show the "product" itself. Instead, they must:
- Show photographs of business premises protected by their insurance
- Display certificates of coverage prominently in offices
- Create professional policy documents that feel substantial
- Use before-and-after photos of claim settlements showing businesses restored
- Feature testimonials from business owners whose companies survived fires due to insurance

**Comparison with Tangible Products:**

| **Aspect** | **Tangible Product (e.g., Smartphone)** | **Insurance Product** |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical presence** | Can be held, examined, tested | No physical presence |
| **Demonstration** | Features can be demonstrated | Only documents and promises |
| **Immediate value** | Used and enjoyed immediately | Value realized only upon claim |
| **Quality assessment** | Visible quality indicators | Quality known only after claim |
| **Display** | Showroom display possible | Only documents and information |

---

#### **2. Inseparability**

**Definition:** Insurance production and consumption cannot be separated; the service is created and delivered simultaneously through the customer-company relationship.

**Characteristics:**
- No inventory can be held
- Provider and customer interact directly
- Service quality depends on interaction
- Personal relationship is integral
- Cannot be quality-tested before delivery

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** The customer participates in service creation, making consistency difficult and making the human element critical.

**Marketing Solutions:**

- **Invest in people:** Train employees and agents extensively
  - Product knowledge and technical expertise
  - Communication and interpersonal skills
  - Empathy and customer orientation
  - Problem-solving capabilities

- **Standardize processes:** Create consistency
  - Standard operating procedures
  - Scripts and guidelines for interactions
  - Quality control checkpoints
  - Service delivery protocols

- **Manage interactions:** Every touchpoint matters
  - Professional appearance and demeanor
  - Consistent brand experience
  - Responsive communication
  - Complaint handling excellence

- **Build relationships:** Long-term focus
  - Relationship managers for key accounts
  - Regular customer engagement
  - Personalized service
  - Loyalty programs

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

When a customer in Dhaka purchases health insurance from Delta Life:
- The insurance is "produced" through the interaction between the customer and the insurance agent
- The agent's professionalism, knowledge, and trustworthiness directly affect the customer's perception of the product
- The policy value is experienced through subsequent interactions (renewals, claims, queries)
- If the agent provides poor service, the "product" itself is perceived as poor
- The company cannot produce the insurance in advance and store it for sale later

---

#### **3. Perishability**

**Definition:** Insurance services cannot be stored, saved, or inventoried for future sale.

**Characteristics:**
- Cannot be warehoused
- Unused capacity is lost forever
- Demand fluctuations create challenges
- Time-dependent nature

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** Managing capacity and demand fluctuations without the buffer of inventory.

**Marketing Solutions:**

- **Demand management:**
  - Differential pricing (discounts for early renewals)
  - Promotional campaigns during slow periods
  - Targeted marketing to smooth demand
  - Incentives for off-peak purchases

- **Capacity management:**
  - Flexible staffing (temporary agents during busy periods)
  - Technology to handle volume (automated underwriting)
  - Outsourcing during peak times
  - Self-service options

**Example:**

If an insurance agent has capacity to sell 10 policies per day but only sells 5, the unused capacity for those 5 policies is lost forever—it cannot be "stored" for tomorrow when demand might be higher. Unlike a store selling clothes that can keep inventory for future sale, the agent's time and capacity are perishable.

---

#### **4. Variability (Heterogeneity)**

**Definition:** Insurance service quality varies depending on who provides it, when, where, and how.

**Characteristics:**
- Service differs by provider
- Same provider may deliver differently at different times
- Customer involvement affects outcome
- Difficult to standardize completely

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** Ensuring consistent quality across all customer interactions and touchpoints.

**Marketing Solutions:**

- **Standardization efforts:**
  - Training programs for consistency
  - Technology-enabled service delivery
  - Quality monitoring and audits
  - Best practice documentation

- **Customization advantages:**
  - Personalized solutions
  - Flexibility to meet specific needs
  - Relationship-based service
  - Adaptive approach

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

Two customers purchasing identical motor insurance policies from the same company may have completely different experiences:
- **Customer A:** Served by experienced, professional agent in Dhaka who explains coverage clearly, processes application efficiently, and maintains regular contact
- **Customer B:** Served by new agent in Sylhet who lacks product knowledge, makes errors in application, and rarely follows up

Despite buying the same "product," their perception of quality varies dramatically based on the service provider.

---

#### **5. No Transfer of Ownership**

**Definition:** Purchasing insurance does not transfer ownership of any tangible asset; customers buy the right to financial compensation if specified events occur.

**Characteristics:**
- Customer owns a contract, not a physical item
- Rights and obligations defined in policy
- Cannot be transferred easily (except in some cases)
- Value exists only within contractual relationship

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** Customers may not feel they "own" anything tangible for their money.

**Marketing Solutions:**

- **Emphasize security and peace of mind:** Focus on emotional benefits
- **Provide tangible policy documents:** Make the contract feel substantial
- **Regular communication:** Reinforce value through ongoing engagement
- **Value-added services:** Provide additional benefits beyond claim payment

**Example:**

When someone pays BDT 500,000 for a car, they own a physical asset they can use, enjoy, show to others, and resell. When they pay BDT 30,000 for car insurance, they own nothing tangible—only a promise that if something happens to their car, they will receive compensation. This lack of tangible ownership makes the purchase psychologically less satisfying, requiring different marketing approaches.

---

#### **6. Customer Hopes Never to Use It**

**Definition:** Unlike most products, customers hope never to need to use their insurance.

**Characteristics:**
- Value is conditional and future
- Non-use is actually the best outcome
- Creates cognitive dissonance
- "Wasted money" perception if no claim

**Unique Challenge:**

This creates a paradox unique to insurance marketing: selling a product that customers hope will never prove its value.

**Implications for Marketing:**

**Challenge:** Overcoming the perception that premiums paid without claims are wasted money.

**Marketing Solutions:**

- **Reframe the value proposition:**
  - "You're buying peace of mind, not hoping for disaster"
  - "Protection is the product, not the claim payment"
  - "Insurance lets you sleep soundly"
  - "Financial security has value even if unused"

- **Emphasize prevention benefits:**
  - Risk assessment and loss control services
  - Safety guidance and resources
  - Wellness programs (health insurance)
  - Value beyond claims

- **Provide value during policy period:**
  - Regular communication and updates
  - Educational content
  - Loyalty rewards
  - Additional services and benefits

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

A factory owner pays BDT 2 million in fire insurance premiums over 10 years without experiencing a fire. He may think: "I wasted BDT 2 million!" Marketing must help him understand: "You bought 10 years of financial security that allowed you to operate confidently, secure loans, and sleep peacefully—that wasn't wasted, that was the product's value."

### 7.1.3 The Insurance Purchase Decision Process

Understanding how customers make insurance purchase decisions is crucial for effective marketing:

#### **Traditional Consumer Decision Process:**

```
1. NEED RECOGNITION
   ↓
2. INFORMATION SEARCH
   ↓
3. EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES
   ↓
4. PURCHASE DECISION
   ↓
5. POST-PURCHASE EVALUATION
```

#### **Applied to Insurance:**

**1. Need Recognition (Problem Awareness)**

**Triggers:**
- Life events (marriage, birth, home purchase, starting business)
- External requirements (mandatory motor insurance, lender requirement)
- Negative events (friend's accident, news of disaster)
- Agent solicitation
- Employer offering group coverage

**Marketing Implications:**
- Create awareness of risk exposure
- Educate about financial consequences
- Time marketing around life events
- Use fear appeals carefully and ethically

**Example:** A young couple gets married in Dhaka. This life event triggers recognition that they now have mutual financial dependency, making life insurance relevant.

---

**2. Information Search**

**Sources:**
- Insurance agents and brokers
- Company websites and social media
- Comparison websites
- Friends and family recommendations
- Online reviews and forums
- Financial advisors

**Search Characteristics:**
- Often limited due to low interest
- Heavy reliance on personal recommendations
- Agent influence is strong
- Complexity creates information overload
- Trust is critical in source selection

**Marketing Implications:**
- Be findable online with strong SEO
- Provide clear, simple information
- Use trusted endorsements and testimonials
- Simplify complex terminology
- Make agent network accessible

---

**3. Evaluation of Alternatives**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Company reputation and stability:** Financial strength, longevity
- **Price (premium):** Affordability, value for money
- **Coverage:** Breadth and depth of protection
- **Service quality:** Responsiveness, professionalism
- **Claims reputation:** Speed and fairness
- **Convenience:** Accessibility, ease of purchase and servicing
- **Additional benefits:** Value-added services, riders

**Challenges:**
- Difficult to compare complex products
- Price sensitivity despite intangibility
- Company differentiation is challenging
- Agent relationship influences choice

**Marketing Implications:**
- Differentiate clearly from competitors
- Provide comparison tools and information
- Emphasize unique value propositions
- Build strong brand identity
- Showcase claims settlement record

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

A business owner in Chittagong compares fire insurance from three companies:
- **SBC:** Lower premium, government backing, but slow claims reputation
- **Green Delta:** Higher premium, fast claims, excellent service
- **Local insurer:** Lowest premium, personal relationship with agent, unknown claims record

The choice depends on which criteria matter most to this specific customer.

---

**4. Purchase Decision**

**Influences:**
- Agent recommendation and persuasion
- Trust in company/agent
- Price and payment flexibility
- Social proof (others' choices)
- Emotional comfort
- Urgency or deadline

**Decision Characteristics:**
- Often involves significant deliberation
- May be postponed repeatedly
- External requirements accelerate decision
- Agent relationship often decisive
- Emotional factors outweigh rational analysis

**Marketing Implications:**
- Remove purchase barriers
- Simplify application process
- Provide flexible payment options
- Create urgency without excessive pressure
- Build trust before asking for commitment
- Provide reassurance and guarantees

---

**5. Post-Purchase Evaluation**

**Evaluation Factors:**
- **Service experience:** Communication, responsiveness, problem resolution
- **Renewal process:** Convenience, price changes
- **Claims experience (if applicable):** Speed, fairness, satisfaction
- **Value perception:** Was premium worth the protection?
- **Agent relationship:** Ongoing support and service

**Outcomes:**
- Policy renewal or lapse
- Additional coverage purchase
- Word-of-mouth recommendations
- Brand loyalty or switching
- Complaints or compliments

**Marketing Implications:**
- Deliver on promises consistently
- Maintain relationship after sale
- Proactive communication
- Exceed expectations in claims handling
- Create loyalty programs
- Solicit feedback and act on it

**Critical Insight:** In insurance, post-purchase evaluation largely determines lifetime value. Acquiring a customer is just the beginning; retention and cross-selling generate the real profitability.

**Example:** A satisfied life insurance customer in Bangladesh typically:
- Renews policy consistently for 20-30 years
- Purchases additional policies for family members
- Recommends company to friends and relatives
- Becomes a valuable lifetime customer worth millions in premiums

---

### 7.1.4 Special Characteristics of Insurance Buying Behavior

#### **Low Involvement Purchase (Usually)**

**Characteristics:**
- Limited information search
- Minimal comparison shopping
- Heavy reliance on recommendations
- Quick decision once convinced

**Exception:** High-value purchases (life insurance with large sum assured) involve higher involvement.

**Marketing Implication:** Make buying easy and reduce decision complexity.

---

#### **Distress Purchase**

**Reality:** Many people buy insurance reluctantly, under pressure, or when required, not enthusiastically.

**Reasons:**
- Discussing death, accidents, or disasters is uncomfortable
- Paying for something you hope never to use feels wasteful
- Complex products are confusing
- Distrust of insurance companies or agents

**Marketing Implication:** Overcome negative emotions through positive framing, education, and building emotional connection to benefits.

---

#### **Trust-Dependent**

**Critical Factor:** Insurance purchase requires trusting a company to fulfill promises years in the future.

**Trust Builders:**
- Company reputation and longevity
- Financial strength ratings
- Transparent communication
- Agent integrity and professionalism
- Positive word-of-mouth

**Marketing Implication:** Every marketing activity must build and reinforce trust—it's the foundation of insurance sales.

---

## 7.2 Marketing Mix (7Ps) in Insurance

The marketing mix—traditionally known as the 4Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)—has been expanded to 7Ps for services marketing, adding People, Process, and Physical Evidence. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to designing and implementing insurance marketing strategies.

---

### 7.2.1 Product

**In insurance context, "product" refers to the insurance coverage, benefits, features, and services offered to customers.**

#### **Core Product vs. Augmented Product**

**Core Product:** The fundamental benefit—financial protection against specified risks

**Augmented Product:** Additional features and services that differentiate the offering:
- Policy terms and conditions
- Coverage limits and exclusions
- Riders and add-ons
- Value-added services
- Customer support

#### **Product Decisions in Insurance:**

**1. Product Portfolio Design**

Insurance companies must decide which products to offer:

**Life Insurance Company Portfolio:**
- Term life insurance
- Endowment plans
- Whole life insurance
- Pension and retirement products
- Child plans
- Unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs)
- Health and critical illness riders

**General Insurance Company Portfolio:**
- Fire insurance
- Marine insurance
- Motor insurance
- Health insurance
- Engineering insurance
- Liability insurance
- Specialized niche products

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Market demand and gap analysis
- Company expertise and capacity
- Competitive differentiation
- Regulatory requirements
- Reinsurance availability
- Profitability potential

**Example - Bangladesh:**

MetLife Bangladesh might focus on:
- Urban, affluent customers seeking retirement solutions (core strength)
- Unit-linked products for investment-minded customers
- Corporate group insurance (scale advantage)

Rather than competing in price-sensitive, rural micro-insurance where JBC dominates.

---

**2. Product Features and Benefits**

**Features:** Specific characteristics of the insurance product
- Sum assured amount
- Premium payment options
- Policy term
- Maturity benefits
- Death benefits
- Loan facility
- Surrender value

**Benefits:** The value customers receive
- **Functional benefits:** Financial protection, wealth creation, tax savings
- **Emotional benefits:** Peace of mind, security, responsibility fulfillment
- **Social benefits:** Family protection, social status

**Marketing Challenge:** Translate technical features into meaningful benefits.

**Poor Marketing:** "Our policy offers a 20-year endowment with guaranteed maturity benefit equal to sum assured plus accumulated bonuses."

**Effective Marketing:** "Guarantee your daughter's education funding—receive BDT 2 million when she turns 18, exactly when university expenses begin, regardless of what happens to you."

---

**3. Product Differentiation**

In commoditized insurance markets, differentiation is challenging but crucial:

**Differentiation Strategies:**

**Coverage Differentiation:**
- Broader coverage than competitors
- Unique policy features
- Innovative riders and add-ons
- Higher coverage limits
- Fewer exclusions

**Example:** A health insurance policy that covers pre-existing conditions after a waiting period (most exclude them entirely) differentiates itself significantly.

**Service Differentiation:**
- 24/7 claims hotline
- Online policy management
- Dedicated relationship managers
- Faster claims settlement
- Cashless claim facilities

**Brand Differentiation:**
- Strong brand identity and reputation
- Emotional brand connections
- Corporate social responsibility
- Specialized expertise (e.g., "The motor insurance specialist")

---

**4. Product Development and Innovation**

Insurance companies must continuously innovate to meet evolving customer needs:

**Innovation Approaches:**

**Customization:**
- Flexible premium payment options
- Modular coverage design (choose what you need)
- Adjustable sum assured
- Personalized policy terms

**Example:** A flexible life insurance plan allowing customers to increase coverage when they get married or have children, without medical underwriting.

**Technology Integration:**
- Usage-based insurance (telematics in motor insurance)
- Parametric insurance (automatic payout based on triggers)
- On-demand insurance (buy coverage for specific time periods)
- Digital-first products

**Example - Bangladesh Context:**

**Rideshare Driver Insurance:** A micro-insurance product for ride-sharing drivers (Uber, Pathao) covering:
- Per-trip accident coverage
- Automatically activated when accepting ride
- Premium of BDT 5-10 per trip
- Instant purchase through mobile app
- Claims processed digitally

This innovative product addresses a specific emerging need in Bangladesh's urban transportation sector.

**New Market Products:**
- Cyber insurance for businesses
- Climate risk insurance for farmers
- Drone insurance
- Cryptocurrency insurance
- Pandemic business interruption coverage

---

**5. Product Life Cycle Management**

Insurance products also follow life cycles requiring different marketing strategies:

**Introduction Stage:**
- High marketing investment
- Customer education focus
- Pricing for market entry
- Limited distribution
- Awareness building

**Growth Stage:**
- Rapid sales growth
- Expanded distribution
- Competition increases
- Brand building
- Service quality emphasis

**Maturity Stage:**
- Market saturation
- Intense price competition
- Product differentiation crucial
- Focus on retention and loyalty
- Cost efficiency important

**Decline Stage:**
- Sales declining
- Reduce marketing spend
- Harvest profits or discontinue
- Focus on renewal of existing policies
- Minimize new business costs

**Example - Bangladesh:**

**Traditional Endowment Plans:** Mature stage
- Market saturated
- Price competition intense
- Limited growth potential
- Focus on renewals

**Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs):** Growth stage
- Increasing customer awareness
- Growing sales
- New competitors entering
- Investment in distribution and marketing

---

### 7.2.2 Price

**In insurance, "price" is the premium charged for coverage.**

#### **Unique Aspects of Insurance Pricing:**

**1. Price is Uncertain Cost**

Unlike typical products where price covers cost plus profit, insurance pricing involves:
- Estimating future uncertain claims
- Long time horizon (especially life insurance)
- Investment income consideration
- Regulatory constraints

**2. Price Paid Before Value Received**

Customers pay premiums upfront for protection that may provide value far in the future, requiring trust and perceived fairness.

**3. Price Influences Risk Pool**

**Adverse Selection:** If prices are too low, high-risk customers dominate; if too high, low-risk customers leave.

---

#### **Pricing Objectives:**

**1. Profitability:**
- Cover expected claims
- Cover expenses
- Generate acceptable profit margin
- Provide return on capital

**2. Market Share:**
- Competitive pricing for growth
- Penetration pricing for new markets
- Volume targets

**3. Risk Selection:**
- Attract profitable risk segments
- Deter unprofitable risks
- Balance risk pool composition

**4. Regulatory Compliance:**
- Meet solvency requirements
- Follow rate filing regulations
- Avoid discriminatory pricing
- Adhere to mandatory pricing (e.g., third-party motor)

---

#### **Pricing Strategies:**

**1. Actuarial Pricing (Risk-Based)**

**Principle:** Premium reflects individual's risk characteristics

**Factors Considered:**

**Life Insurance:**
- Age
- Gender
- Health status and medical history
- Occupation
- Lifestyle (smoking, alcohol)
- Family medical history
- Sum assured amount
- Policy term

**Example:** A 25-year-old non-smoking software engineer pays significantly lower life insurance premiums than a 45-year-old smoking construction worker for the same coverage.

**Motor Insurance:**
- Vehicle type and value
- Driver age and experience
- Driving history (accidents, violations)
- Usage (personal vs. commercial)
- Geographic location
- Security features

**2. Community Rating**

**Principle:** Same premium for all in defined group, regardless of individual risk

**Application:**
- Group insurance plans
- Mandatory insurance programs
- Social insurance schemes

**Example:** All employees of a company pay the same group health insurance premium regardless of age or health status.

**Advantages:**
- Simplicity
- Inclusivity (high-risk individuals can afford coverage)
- Administrative efficiency

**Disadvantages:**
- Low-risk individuals subsidize high-risk
- Potential for adverse selection
- May not reflect true risk

---

**3. Competitive Pricing**

**Principle:** Price based on competitors' rates rather than pure actuarial calculation

**Approach:**
- Monitor competitor pricing
- Price at, above, or below market
- Respond to competitive moves

**Bangladesh Context:**

**Motor insurance** market is highly price-competitive:
- Companies often underprice to gain market share
- Leads to underwriting losses
- Profitability depends on volume and investment income
- "Race to the bottom" concerns

**Challenges:**
- Unsustainable pricing
- Quality and service compromises
- Financial instability risk
- Market conduct issues

---

**4. Value-Based Pricing**

**Principle:** Price reflects perceived value to customer, not just cost

**Application:**
- Premium products with superior service
- Specialized coverage
- Brand-based pricing
- Value-added services included

**Example:** MetLife might charge 10-15% higher premiums than local competitors but justify through:
- International brand reputation
- Superior claims handling
- Technology platform
- Professional service
- Financial strength

---

**5. Penetration Pricing**

**Principle:** Low initial pricing to gain market share rapidly

**Application:**
- New product launches
- Entering new markets
- Building customer base

**Example:** A new insurance company in Bangladesh might offer motor insurance 15-20% below market rates for the first year to attract customers, planning to raise rates once established.

**Risks:**
- Adverse selection (attracting worst risks)
- Establishing unprofitable precedent
- Difficulty raising prices later
- Financial losses

---

**6. Skimming Pricing**

**Principle:** High initial pricing for unique or differentiated products

**Application:**
- Innovative products with little competition
- Luxury or specialized coverage
- Targeting affluent segments

**Example:** When cyber insurance was first introduced in Bangladesh, companies charged premium prices due to limited competition, specialization, and target market's ability to pay.

---

#### **Pricing Tactics:**

**1. Discounts and Incentives**

**No-Claim Bonus (NCB):**
- Motor insurance discount for claim-free years
- Typically 10-50% depending on years claim-free
- Encourages careful driving and retention

**Example:** A motor insurance policyholder in Bangladesh with 5 consecutive claim-free years receives 50% NCB, reducing premium from BDT 30,000 to BDT 15,000.

**Volume Discounts:**
- Lower rates for group policies
- Fleet insurance discounts
- Multiple policy discounts

**Early Payment Discounts:**
- Incentive for paying annual premium upfront
- Reduces collection costs
- Improves cash flow

**2. Premium Payment Options**

**Flexibility in Payment:**
- Annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly
- Single premium vs. regular premium
- Limited pay (pay for 10 years, coverage for 20)
- Flexible premium (ULIPs)

**Trade-offs:**
- Annual payment: Lower total cost, higher discount
- Monthly payment: More affordable, higher total cost, convenience

**Example:** A life insurance policy with annual premium of BDT 12,000 might cost BDT 13,200 if paid monthly (BDT 1,100 × 12) due to administrative costs and lost investment income.

**3. Deductibles and Co-Payments**

**Purpose:** Share risk with insured, reduce premiums, prevent frivolous claims

**Deductible:** Amount insured pays before insurance coverage begins

**Example:** Motor insurance with BDT 5,000 deductible costs 15-20% less than zero-deductible policy.

**Co-payment:** Percentage of each claim insured pays

**Example:** Health insurance with 20% co-payment means insurer pays 80%, insured pays 20% of each medical bill.

---

### 7.2.3 Place (Distribution)

**"Place" refers to how insurance products reach customers—the distribution channels and locations where insurance is made available.**

Distribution is particularly critical in insurance because:
- Products are intangible (can't be displayed in stores)
- Explanation and advice are often needed
- Trust and personal relationships matter
- Regulatory and licensing requirements exist

#### **Distribution Channels (Detailed in Section 7.3)**

**Primary Channels:**
1. Agents (career and independent)
2. Brokers
3. Bancassurance
4. Direct marketing
5. Digital channels
6. Alternative channels

**Distribution Strategy Decisions:**

**1. Channel Selection**

**Factors to Consider:**
- Target customer characteristics
- Product complexity
- Company resources and capacity
- Cost structure
- Control vs. coverage trade-offs
- Competitive landscape

**Example - Bangladesh:**

**JBC** relies heavily on:
- Branch network (physical presence in all districts)
- Development centers in rural areas
- Career agents with local community ties
- Government employee direct marketing

**MetLife** focuses on:
- Selective agent force (quality over quantity)
- Bancassurance partnerships with leading banks
- Corporate direct sales for group insurance
- Digital channels for urban customers

Different distribution strategies reflect different target markets, resources, and competitive positioning.

---

**2. Channel Mix and Integration**

**Multi-Channel Strategy:**

Modern insurers use multiple channels simultaneously:
- Agents for complex products requiring advice
- Banks for simple, standardized products
- Digital for tech-savvy customers
- Direct marketing for specific segments

**Omni-Channel Approach:**

Seamless integration across channels:
- Customer can start application online, complete with agent
- Agent-sold policy can be serviced through mobile app
- Claims initiated digitally, finalized through branch
- Consistent experience across all touchpoints

**Example:** A customer in Dhaka:
1. Researches life insurance on company website
2. Uses online calculator to determine coverage needs
3. Requests agent callback through website
4. Agent visits home for detailed consultation
5. Application submitted digitally
6. Policy issued and delivered by agent
7. Premium payments automated through mobile banking
8. Policy servicing through mobile app

---

**3. Geographic Coverage**

**Market Coverage Strategies:**

**Intensive Distribution:**
- Maximum coverage across all locations
- Many agents and branches
- Suitable for mass-market products
- High cost but maximum reach

**Example:** JBC's extensive rural branch network provides intensive distribution for basic life insurance.

**Selective Distribution:**
- Limited number of carefully chosen intermediaries
- Focus on key markets and segments
- Balance between coverage and control
- Moderate cost

**Example:** Private insurers focusing on divisional cities and major district towns.

**Exclusive Distribution:**
- Very limited, exclusive intermediaries
- Premium products or specialized coverage
- High control, limited reach
- Lower distribution cost per policy

**Example:** Specialized reinsurance brokers for complex industrial risks.

---

**4. Distribution Channel Management**

**Agent/Broker Recruitment and Selection:**
- Screening and background checks
- Licensing and regulatory compliance
- Training and certification
- Performance expectations

**Training and Development:**
- Initial product training
- Sales techniques
- Customer service skills
- Regulatory compliance
- Ongoing professional development

**Motivation and Compensation:**
- Commission structures
- Performance bonuses and incentives
- Recognition programs
- Career progression opportunities
- Contests and rewards

**Monitoring and Control:**
- Sales targets and KPIs
- Quality metrics (persistency, complaints)
- Compliance audits
- Mystery shopping
- Customer feedback

---

### 7.2.4 Promotion

**"Promotion" encompasses all communication activities to inform, persuade, and remind customers about insurance products.**

#### **Promotional Mix Elements:**

**1. Advertising**

**Definition:** Paid, non-personal communication through mass media

**Objectives:**
- Build brand awareness
- Create product interest
- Generate leads
- Communicate brand positioning
- Support agents/distributors

**Media Channels:**

**Traditional Media:**

**Television:**

- Company logo and contact information

**Print Media (Newspapers, Magazines):**
- Detailed information possible
- Targeting based on publication
- Moderate cost
- Declining readership (especially among youth)

**Radio:**
- Local market targeting
- Lower cost than TV
- Limited visual impact
- Good for reminders and reinforcement

## Review Questions

**Conceptual Understanding:**

1. Explain why the intangibility of insurance makes marketing more challenging than marketing physical products. Provide at least three specific marketing implications.

2. Compare and contrast the roles of insurance agents and insurance brokers. From a customer's perspective, when would using a broker be more beneficial than an agent?

3. Describe the seven elements of the marketing mix (7Ps) as they apply to insurance, providing specific examples from the Bangladeshi insurance market.

4. Why is "People" considered a critical element of insurance marketing mix? Discuss with reference to employees, agents, and customers.

**Application Questions:**

5. You are the marketing manager for a new private life insurance company entering the Bangladeshi market. Design a comprehensive marketing strategy covering product positioning, pricing, distribution channels, and promotional activities.

6. Bancassurance is growing rapidly in Bangladesh. Explain how bancassurance works and design a partnership model between a commercial bank and a life insurance company.

7. A general insurance company is experiencing low trust among customers due to past claims settlement issues. Develop a trust-rebuilding marketing campaign addressing this challenge.

8. Design a micro-insurance product and distribution strategy specifically for rural farmers in Bangladesh, addressing affordability, accessibility, and awareness challenges.

**Critical Thinking:**

9. Digital insurance channels are growing globally but face challenges in Bangladesh. Analyze the opportunities and barriers for digital insurance distribution in the Bangladeshi context. What strategies would you recommend to accelerate digital adoption?

10. "The agent distribution system is outdated and inefficient—insurance companies should replace agents with digital channels entirely." Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Justify your position with economic, social, and practical considerations.

11. Evaluate the ethical implications of commission-based compensation for insurance agents. Does this structure incentivize mis-selling? What alternative compensation models might better align agent interests with customer welfare?

12. Insurance marketing in Bangladesh faces a fundamental challenge: selling a product people hope never to use. How can insurance marketers reframe this paradox to make insurance more emotionally appealing and psychologically satisfying to purchase?
