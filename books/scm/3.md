## 3.6 Models for Facility Location and Capacity Allocation

More advanced models simultaneously optimize both facility locations and the allocation of capacity and flows throughout the network.

### 3.6.1 Capacitated Plant Location Model

**Purpose:** Determine which facilities to open, their capacities, and how to allocate demand to facilities, considering capacity constraints.

**When to Use:**
- Multiple potential facility locations
- Facilities have capacity limitations
- Need to allocate customers to facilities
- Total cost minimization objective

**Problem Description:**

Given:
- Set of potential facility locations
- Fixed cost of opening each facility
- Capacity limit for each facility
- Set of customer demand points
- Transportation cost from each facility to each customer
- Customer demand quantities

Determine:
- Which facilities to open
- How much capacity to install at each facility
- Which facilities serve which customers
- How much to ship from each facility to each customer

Objective:
- Minimize total cost (fixed facility costs + transportation costs)

**Mathematical Formulation:**

**Sets:**
- I = {1, 2, ..., m} set of potential facility locations
- J = {1, 2, ..., n} set of customer locations

**Parameters:**
- fi = fixed cost of opening facility i
- Ki = capacity of facility i (if opened)
- dj = demand at customer j
- cij = cost of shipping one unit from facility i to customer j

**Decision Variables:**
- yi = 1 if facility i is opened, 0 otherwise (binary)
- xij = quantity shipped from facility i to customer j (continuous, ≥ 0)

**Objective Function:**

Minimize Z = ∑ fi · yi + ∑∑ cij · xij
            i∈I        i∈I j∈J

**Constraints:**

1. **Demand satisfaction:** Each customer's demand must be met
   ∑ xij = dj, for all j ∈ J
   i∈I

2. **Capacity constraint:** Shipments from a facility cannot exceed capacity
   ∑ xij ≤ Ki · yi, for all i ∈ I
   j∈J

3. **Binary constraint:** Facility is either open or closed
   yi ∈ {0, 1}, for all i ∈ I

4. **Non-negativity:** Shipments must be non-negative
   xij ≥ 0, for all i ∈ I, j ∈ J

**Interpretation:**
- The model balances fixed costs (opening facilities) against variable costs (transportation)
- Capacity constraints ensure realistic solutions
- Binary variables (yi) make this a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem

### 3.6.2 Example: Capacitated Plant Location Problem

**Scenario:**

A company is considering opening distribution centers (DCs) in three cities to serve four customer zones. The data is as follows:

**Potential DC Locations:**

| **DC Location** | **Fixed Cost (annual)** | **Capacity (units/year)** |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| DC 1 (North) | $400,000 | 800,000 |
| DC 2 (Central) | $500,000 | 1,000,000 |
| DC 3 (South) | $350,000 | 600,000 |

**Customer Demand:**

| **Customer Zone** | **Annual Demand (units)** |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Zone A | 300,000 |
| Zone B | 400,000 |
| Zone C | 250,000 |
| Zone D | 350,000 |
| **Total** | **1,300,000** |

**Transportation Costs ($ per unit):**

| **From/To** | **Zone A** | **Zone B** | **Zone C** | **Zone D** |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **DC 1** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 7 |
| **DC 2** | 3 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| **DC 3** | 6 | 5 | 2 | 3 |

**Question:** Which DCs should be opened, and how should customer zones be served to minimize total costs?

**Solution Approach:**

This problem requires optimization software (Excel Solver, Python with PuLP, CPLEX, etc.). Here's a conceptual solution:

**Step 1: Formulate the Model**
- Variables: y1, y2, y3 (binary: open DC or not)
- Variables: x11, x12, ..., x34 (continuous: units shipped from each DC to each zone)
- Objective: Minimize total costs
- Constraints: Demand satisfaction, capacity limits, logical constraints

**Step 2: Solve Using Optimization Software**

**Optimal Solution (illustrative):**

| **Decision** | **Result** |
|--------------|-----------|
| Open DC 1? | Yes (y1 = 1) |
| Open DC 2? | Yes (y2 = 1) |
| Open DC 3? | No (y3 = 0) |

**Allocation Plan:**

| **From** | **To Zone A** | **To Zone B** | **To Zone C** | **To Zone D** | **Total Shipped** |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| DC 1 | 300,000 | 0 | 0 | 500,000 | 800,000 |
| DC 2 | 0 | 400,000 | 250,000 | 350,000 | 1,000,000 |
| DC 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**Cost Calculation:**

**Fixed Costs:**
- DC 1: $400,000
- DC 2: $500,000
- DC 3: $0 (not opened)
- **Total Fixed Cost:** $900,000

**Transportation Costs:**
- DC 1 → Zone A: 300,000 × $2 = $600,000
- DC 1 → Zone D: 500,000 × $7 = $3,500,000
- DC 2 → Zone B: 400,000 × $2 = $800,000
- DC 2 → Zone C: 250,000 × $3 = $750,000
- DC 2 → Zone D: 350,000 × $5 = $1,750,000
- **Total Transportation Cost:** $7,400,000

**Total Cost:** $900,000 + $7,400,000 = **$8,300,000**

**Insights:**
- Opening DC 3 is not economical despite lower fixed cost
- DC 1 and DC 2 together provide sufficient capacity (1.8M vs. 1.3M demand)
- Trade-off between fixed costs and transportation costs determines optimal configuration

## 3.9 Impact of Uncertainty on Network Design

Uncertainty is inherent in business environments. Effective network design must account for various sources of uncertainty and incorporate strategies to manage them.

### 3.9.1 Types of Uncertainty in Network Design

**1. Demand Uncertainty**
- **Volume uncertainty**: Total market size variations
- **Mix uncertainty**: Product mix changes
- **Geographic uncertainty**: Demand location shifts
- **Timing uncertainty**: Seasonal and cyclical fluctuations

**Sources:**
- Economic conditions
- Competitor actions
- Technology changes
- Consumer preferences evolution

**2. Supply Uncertainty**
- **Supplier reliability**: On-time delivery, quality issues
- **Capacity availability**: Supplier constraints
- **Input cost variability**: Raw material price fluctuations
- **Geopolitical risks**: Trade policies, tariffs, sanctions

**3. Cost Uncertainty**
- **Transportation costs**: Fuel prices, capacity availability
- **Labor costs**: Wage inflation, benefit costs
- **Real estate costs**: Facility lease or purchase prices
- **Tax policy**: Changes in corporate tax rates, incentives

**4. Regulatory and Political Uncertainty**
- **Trade policies**: Tariff changes, trade agreements
- **Environmental regulations**: Emissions standards, waste disposal
- **Labor laws**: Minimum wage, working hours, benefits
- **Political instability**: Government changes, civil unrest

**5. Disruption Uncertainty**
- **Natural disasters**: Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes
- **Pandemics**: COVID-19 impact on supply chains
- **Technology failures**: Cyberattacks, system outages
- **Infrastructure failures**: Port closures, transportation disruptions

**6. Technological Uncertainty**
- **Process innovations**: New manufacturing technologies
- **Product innovations**: New product launches, obsolescence
- **Digital disruption**: E-commerce growth, automation

---

### 3.9.2 Impact of Uncertainty on Network Decisions

**Traditional deterministic approach:**
- Use single-point estimates (expected demand, average costs)
- Optimize for the "most likely" scenario
- Results in brittle networks vulnerable to deviations

**Problems with ignoring uncertainty:**
- **Insufficient capacity**: Can't handle demand spikes
- **Wrong locations**: Optimized for scenario that doesn't occur
- **Excessive costs**: Must pay premium for last-minute adjustments
- **Service failures**: Can't meet customer commitments during disruptions

**Example:**
> *A company designs a network for expected demand of 1 million units. Actual demand is 1.3 million. The network can't handle the volume, resulting in lost sales, expedited shipping costs, and customer dissatisfaction.*

---

### 3.9.3 Strategies for Managing Uncertainty

**1. Robust Network Design**

**Concept:** Design networks that perform reasonably well across multiple scenarios rather than optimizing for a single scenario.

**Approaches:**
- **Scenario analysis**: Develop 3-5 distinct future scenarios
- **Evaluate each design**: How does it perform in each scenario?
- **Select robust design**: Acceptable performance in all scenarios

**Example Scenarios:**
- Optimistic: High demand growth, stable costs
- Base case: Moderate growth, gradual cost increases
- Pessimistic: Low growth, significant cost inflation
- Disruption: Major supply chain disruption occurs

**Robust Design Characteristics:**
- Performs adequately (not optimally) in all scenarios
- Avoids catastrophic outcomes in any scenario
- May sacrifice some efficiency for reliability

**2. Flexible Network Design**

**Concept:** Build adaptability into the network to respond to actual conditions as they unfold.

**Flexibility Mechanisms:**

**a) Capacity Flexibility**
- Design facilities with expansion capability
- Maintain buffer capacity (10-20% above expected demand)
- Use temporary or seasonal capacity (leased space, contract labor)

**b) Product Flexibility**
- Flexible manufacturing systems can produce multiple products
- Postponement strategies delay product differentiation
- Modular design allows reconfiguration

**c) Supplier Flexibility**
- Multiple suppliers for critical items
- Contracts with flexible volumes
- Backup suppliers on standby

**d) Transportation Flexibility**
- Multi-modal transportation options
- Multiple carriers and routes
- Expedited shipping capabilities when needed

**e) Facility Flexibility**
- Lease vs. own decisions (leasing provides exit options)
- Modular facility designs
- Shared facilities (3PL, co-packing)

**3. Real Options Approach**

**Concept:** Treat network design decisions as options with value that can be exercised, delayed, or abandoned based on future information.

**Types of Real Options:**

**a) Option to Defer**
- Delay facility investment until uncertainty resolves
- Maintain optionality through leases or partnerships
- Value: Avoid commitment in uncertain environment

**b) Option to Expand**
- Build initial facility with expansion capability
- Exercise option if demand materializes
- Value: Upside capture with limited downside

**c) Option to Contract**
- Ability to reduce operations if demand declines
- Lease expiration, equipment sale, workforce reduction
- Value: Downside protection

**d) Option to Switch**
- Flexibility to change products, suppliers, or markets
- Flexible manufacturing, multi-source capability
- Value: Adapt to changing conditions

**e) Option to Abandon**
- Exit strategy if project doesn't meet expectations
- Sale of assets, termination of contracts
- Value: Limit losses in worst-case scenarios

**Example:**
> *Instead of building a 500,000 sq ft warehouse, build 300,000 sq ft on land that can accommodate expansion to 700,000 sq ft. This provides the option to expand if demand grows, while limiting initial investment if it doesn't.*

**4. Stochastic Optimization**

**Concept:** Explicitly incorporate probability distributions of uncertain parameters into optimization models.

**Approach:**
- Model demand, costs, etc. as probability distributions (not single points)
- Optimize for expected value or minimize risk metrics (variance, Value at Risk)
- Generate solutions that account for variability

**Benefits:**
- More realistic representation of uncertainty
- Solutions that balance expected outcomes and risk
- Quantification of uncertainty impact

**Challenges:**
- Requires probability distribution estimation
- Computationally intensive
- May require specialized expertise and software

**5. Adaptive Network Management**

**Concept:** Network design is not static; continuously monitor and adapt as uncertainty resolves.

**Implementation:**

**a) Monitoring Systems**
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Monitor external environment (market trends, competitor actions)
- Early warning systems for disruptions

**b) Trigger Mechanisms**
- Define thresholds that trigger network review
- Examples: Demand change >20%, new competitor entry, major cost shift

**c) Rapid Response Capability**
- Pre-approved contingency plans
- Cross-functional response teams
- Authority to make quick decisions

**d) Continuous Improvement**
- Regular network performance reviews (quarterly, annually)
- Pilot tests of network changes
- Learning from disruptions and near-misses

**6. Risk Pooling and Consolidation**

**Concept:** Aggregate demand across multiple locations or products to reduce uncertainty impact.

**Mechanisms:**

**a) Geographic Pooling**
- Serve multiple markets from centralized facility
- Variability in individual markets cancels out
- Higher overall demand predictability

**b) Product Pooling**
- Use common components across products
- Delay differentiation until demand is known (postponement)
- Reduce SKU-level uncertainty

**c) Temporal Pooling**
- Longer planning horizons smooth variability
- Weekly demand more variable than monthly

**Trade-off:** Pooling reduces uncertainty but may increase transportation costs and lead times.

---

### 3.9.4 Quantifying the Value of Flexibility

Organizations should evaluate whether investment in flexibility is worthwhile.

**Framework:**

1. **Identify uncertainty sources and magnitudes**
   - Demand range: 800K - 1.2M units (base: 1M)
   - Cost range: $8 - $12 per unit (base: $10)

2. **Evaluate rigid network performance**
   - Optimize for base case
   - Calculate costs/profits in optimistic and pessimistic scenarios
   - Expected value considering scenario probabilities

3. **Evaluate flexible network performance**
   - Design with flexibility features
   - Calculate costs/profits across scenarios
   - Expected value considering scenario probabilities

4. **Calculate flexibility value**
   - Flexibility value = Expected value (flexible) - Expected value (rigid)
   - Compare to cost of building in flexibility

5. **Decision**
   - If flexibility value > flexibility cost → Invest in flexibility
   - Otherwise, use rigid design

**Illustrative Example:**

| **Scenario** | **Probability** | **Rigid Network Profit** | **Flexible Network Profit** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Optimistic | 25% | $5,000,000 | $5,200,000 |
| Base Case | 50% | $3,000,000 | $3,000,000 |
| Pessimistic | 25% | $500,000 | $1,200,000 |
| **Expected Value** | | **$2,875,000** | **$3,100,000** |

**Flexibility Value:** $3,100,000 - $2,875,000 = **$225,000**

**If cost of flexibility** (e.g., modular design, expansion option) **< $225,000**, then invest in flexibility.

## 3.10 Chapter Summary

Network design is a critical strategic decision that shapes supply chain performance for years to come. This chapter has covered:

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Strategic Importance**
   - Network design determines cost structure, service capabilities, and competitive positioning
   - Decisions are long-term and capital-intensive

2. **Influencing Factors**
   - Strategic (corporate and competitive strategy alignment)
   - Technological (production, transportation, IT capabilities)
   - Macroeconomic (costs, trade policies, labor markets)
   - Political/regulatory, geographic, competitive, and organizational factors

3. **Design Framework**
   - Phase 1: Define supply chain strategy
   - Phase 2: Define regional facility configuration
   - Phase 3: Select potential sites
   - Phase 4: Make location choices
   - Continuous review and adaptation

4. **Location Models**
   - Qualitative (factor rating)
   - Quantitative (center of gravity, break-even analysis)
   - Optimization (capacitated plant location model)

5. **Role of IT**
   - Data integration and visibility
   - Advanced analytics and optimization
   - Digital technologies (big data, IoT, AI, cloud, digital twins)

6. **Tradition and Modernity**
   - Balance classic efficiency principles with modern responsiveness
   - Hybrid networks segment by product/customer needs
   - Strategic use of technology to enhance traditional strengths

7. **Managing Uncertainty**

   - Real options approach
   - Adaptive network management
   - Resilience strategies (redundancy, collaboration, visibility, diversification)

### **Critical Takeaways:**

- **There is no "perfect" network** – only designs appropriate for specific strategies, markets, and uncertainties
- **Network design requires trade-offs** – cost vs. service, efficiency vs. flexibility, optimization vs. robustness
- **Technology enables but doesn't replace judgment** – Use IT to enhance analysis, but maintain strategic thinking
- **Uncertainty is real and must be managed** – Don't optimize for single scenarios; build adaptability
- **Networks must evolve** – Regular review and willingness to adapt are essential
