## 4.1 Introduction to Global Supply Chain Networks

**Global supply chain networks** span multiple countries and continents, integrating suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers across international borders. Unlike domestic networks that operate within a single country, global networks must navigate diverse regulatory environments, cultural differences, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical complexities.

### 4.1.1 What Makes Supply Chains Global?

A supply chain becomes global when it involves:

- **International sourcing**: Purchasing materials or components from suppliers in other countries
- **Offshore manufacturing**: Production facilities located in foreign countries
- **Global distribution**: Serving customers across multiple countries or regions
- **Cross-border logistics**: Transportation and customs clearance across international borders
- **Multi-country coordination**: Managing operations across different time zones, languages, and business cultures

---

### 4.2.3 Total Cost Perspective

A critical insight: **The lowest purchase price does not guarantee the lowest total cost.**

**Total Landed Cost (TLC)** includes all costs from sourcing to delivery:

```
Total Landed Cost =
    Purchase Price
  + Transportation (inbound and outbound)
  + Customs Duties and Tariffs
  + Inventory Carrying Costs
  + Warehousing and Handling
  + Insurance
  + Quality Control and Inspection
  + Compliance and Documentation
  + Currency Hedging
  + Overhead (coordination, communication, travel)
  + Risk Costs (disruptions, delays, quality issues)
```

**Example Comparison:**

| **Cost Element** | **Domestic Source** | **Offshore Source** |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Unit purchase price | $50 | $30 |
| Transportation | $2 | $8 |
| Duties/tariffs | $0 | $5 |
| Inventory carrying cost | $3 | $7 |
| Quality control | $1 | $3 |
| Coordination overhead | $1 | $4 |
| Risk premium | $2 | $5 |
| **Total Landed Cost** | **$59** | **$62** |

**Key Insight:** Despite a $20 lower purchase price, the offshore source costs $3 more per unit when all factors are considered.

- Flexibility and option value in uncertain environments

---

## 4.3 The Offshoring Decision

**Offshoring** refers to relocating business activities (manufacturing, services, R&D) to another country, typically to achieve cost savings or access specialized capabilities.

### 4.3.1 Offshoring vs. Related Concepts

Understanding the terminology:

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Example** |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Offshoring** | Moving operations to another country | US company manufacturing in Vietnam |
| **Outsourcing** | Contracting with external provider | Company hires 3PL for logistics |
| **Offshore Outsourcing** | Contracting with provider in another country | US company uses call center in Philippines |
| **Nearshoring** | Moving to nearby country | US company manufacturing in Mexico |
| **Reshoring** | Bringing operations back to home country | Bringing manufacturing back to US from China |
| **Onshoring** | Keeping or moving operations domestically | Manufacturing in home country |

**Key Distinction:**
- **Offshoring vs. Outsourcing**: Offshoring is about location (where), outsourcing is about ownership (who)
- Can offshore without outsourcing (own facility abroad)
- Can outsource without offshoring (third party domestically)

---

### 4.3.2 Drivers of Offshoring

**1. Cost Reduction (Primary Driver)**

**Labor Cost Advantages:**
Significant wage differentials drive offshoring decisions.

**Comparative Labor Costs (Manufacturing, approximate):**

### 4.3.4 Offshoring Decision Model

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

**Step 1: Define Scope**
- What activities to potentially offshore?
- Manufacturing, assembly, services, R&D?
- Full or partial offshoring?

**Step 2: Identify Potential Locations**
- Consider multiple countries
- Evaluate based on strategic criteria
- Narrow to 3-5 finalist countries

**Step 3: Calculate Total Landed Cost**

For each location option, calculate comprehensive costs:

**Formula:**

```
Total Annual Cost = 
    (Unit Cost × Annual Volume)
  + Transportation Costs
  + Inventory Carrying Costs
  + Duties and Tariffs
  + Quality and Inspection Costs
  + Coordination and Overhead
  + Setup Costs (amortized)
  + Risk Premium
```

**Step 4: Assess Qualitative Factors**

Use a weighted scoring model:

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Domestic** | **Country A** | **Country B** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Total cost | 40% | Score × Weight | Score × Weight | Score × Weight |
| Quality | 15% | ... | ... | ... |
| Responsiveness | 15% | ... | ... | ... |
| Innovation | 10% | ... | ... | ... |
| Risk | 10% | ... | ... | ... |
| Sustainability | 5% | ... | ... | ... |
| Strategic fit | 5% | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total Score** | **100%** | **Weighted Total** | **Weighted Total** | **Weighted Total** |

**Step 5: Perform Sensitivity Analysis**

Test how changes in key assumptions affect the decision:
- Exchange rate variations (±10%, ±20%)
- Volume changes (high growth, low growth scenarios)
- Labor cost inflation
- Transportation cost changes
- Tariff changes

**Step 6: Make Decision**

Consider:
- Financial analysis results
- Strategic alignment
- Risk tolerance
- Implementation feasibility

**Current Situation (US Production):**
- Annual volume: 500,000 units
- Current US manufacturing cost: $45/unit
- Domestic transportation: $2/unit
- Current total cost: $47/unit
- Total annual cost: $23,500,000

**Mexico Option:**

| **Cost Element** | **Per Unit** | **Annual (500K units)** |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Manufacturing cost | $28 | $14,000,000 |
| Transportation (truck) | $4 | $2,000,000 |
| Customs duties | $1 | $500,000 |
| Inventory carrying (longer lead time) | $2 | $1,000,000 |
| Quality control | $1 | $500,000 |
| Coordination overhead | $0.50 | $250,000 |
| Setup cost (amortized over 5 years) | $0.60 | $300,000 |
| **Total** | **$37.10** | **$18,550,000** |

**Annual Savings vs. US:** $23,500,000 - $18,550,000 = **$4,950,000 (21% reduction)**

---

**China Option:**

| **Cost Element** | **Per Unit** | **Annual (500K units)** |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Manufacturing cost | $22 | $11,000,000 |
| Transportation (ocean freight) | $8 | $4,000,000 |
| Customs duties | $3 | $1,500,000 |
| Inventory carrying (much longer lead time) | $5 | $2,500,000 |
| Quality control | $2 | $1,000,000 |
| Coordination overhead | $1.50 | $750,000 |
| Setup cost (amortized over 5 years) | $1.00 | $500,000 |
| Risk premium (disruptions, IP) | $1.50 | $750,000 |
| **Total** | **$44.00** | **$22,000,000** |

**Annual Savings vs. US:** $23,500,000 - $22,000,000 = **$1,500,000 (6% reduction)**

---

**Comparison Summary:**

| **Option** | **Total Cost/Unit** | **Total Annual Cost** | **Savings vs. US** |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **US (Current)** | $47.00 | $23,500,000 | Baseline |
| **Mexico** | $37.10 | $18,550,000 | $4,950,000 (21%) |
| **China** | $44.00 | $22,000,000 | $1,500,000 (6%) |

**Qualitative Factors:**

| **Factor** | **US** | **Mexico** | **China** |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Lead time | 1 week | 2-3 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| Flexibility | High | Medium | Low |
| Quality control ease | Easy | Moderate | Difficult |
| IP protection | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
| Political risk | Low | Low | Medium |
| Sustainability | Good | Good | Concerns |

**Decision Considerations:**

1. **Mexico offers the best cost savings** (21%) with moderate lead times and risk
2. **China's cost advantage** (initially $22 vs. $28) is largely eroded by additional costs
3. **Responsiveness**: Mexico's shorter lead times better support market changes
4. **Risk**: China poses higher IP and geopolitical risks
5. **Strategic fit**: Mexico aligns with nearshoring trend and USMCA benefits

**Recommendation:** Offshore to Mexico based on superior total cost savings, acceptable lead times, lower risk, and strategic alignment.

## 4.5 Evaluating Global Supply Chain Design

Evaluating global network designs requires comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions, balancing quantitative and qualitative factors.

### 4.5.1 Evaluation Framework

**Dimension 1: Financial Performance**

**Key Metrics:**

**1. Total Landed Cost**
- All-in cost from sourcing to customer delivery
- Most comprehensive cost measure

**2. Return on Investment (ROI)**

```
ROI = (Net Benefits / Investment) × 100%

Where:
Net Benefits = Annual savings or revenue increase
Investment = Initial setup costs
```

**Example:**
```
Investment in new facility: $10M
Annual cost savings: $3M
ROI = ($3M / $10M) × 100% = 30%
```

**3. Net Present Value (NPV)**

```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
t = time period (years)
r = discount rate
```

**Decision Rule:** Accept if NPV > 0

**4. Payback Period**

```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Savings
```

**Example:**
```
Investment: $10M
Annual savings: $3M
Payback = $10M / $3M = 3.33 years
```

**5. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- Discount rate that makes NPV = 0
- Higher IRR preferred
- Compare to hurdle rate (minimum acceptable return)

---

**Dimension 2: Operational Performance**

**Key Metrics:**

**1. Lead Time**

## 4.6 Evaluating Network Design Decisions Using Decision Trees

Decision trees provide a structured framework for making network design decisions under uncertainty by explicitly modeling decisions, uncertain events, and outcomes.

### 4.6.1 Components of Decision Trees

**1. Decision Nodes** (represented by squares □)
- Points where a choice must be made
- Alternative actions branch from these nodes

**2. Chance Nodes** (represented by circles ○)
- Points where uncertain events occur
- Probabilities assigned to each possible outcome

**3. Branches**
- Lines connecting nodes
- Represent alternatives (from decision nodes) or outcomes (from chance nodes)

**4. Outcomes/Payoffs**
- Final results at end of each path
- Typically expressed as profit, cost, or NPV

**5. Probabilities**
- Likelihood of each outcome at chance nodes
- Must sum to 1.0 (100%) for all branches from a chance node

---

### 4.6.2 Building a Decision Tree

**Step 1: Identify the decision**
- What choice needs to be made?
- What are the alternatives?

**Step 2: Identify uncertain events**
- What future events will affect outcomes?
- What are possible scenarios?

**Step 3: Estimate probabilities**
- Assign probability to each scenario
- Use historical data, expert judgment, market research

**Step 4: Estimate payoffs**
- Calculate outcome for each path
- Consider all costs and revenues

**Step 5: Solve the tree**
- Work backward from right to left
- Calculate expected values at chance nodes
- Choose best alternative at decision nodes

---

### 4.6.3 Decision Tree Example: Facility Location

**Problem:**

GlobalManufacturing is deciding where to build a new factory:
- **Option A**: Build in Country X (low cost but higher risk)
- **Option B**: Build in Country Y (moderate cost and risk)
- **Option C**: Build domestically (higher cost but lower risk)

**Uncertain Event:** Market demand over the next 10 years
- **High demand** (30% probability): 200,000 units/year
- **Medium demand** (50% probability): 150,000 units/year
- **Low demand** (20% probability): 100,000 units/year

**Cost Data:**

| **Location** | **Setup Cost** | **Annual Fixed Cost** | **Variable Cost/Unit** | **Political Risk Premium** |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Country X | $20M | $5M | $100 | $2M/year |
| Country Y | $25M | $6M | $120 | $1M/year |
| Domestic | $30M | $8M | $150 | $0 |

**Revenue:** $250 per unit sold

**Time Horizon:** 10 years, discount rate 10%

**Step 1: Calculate Annual Profit for Each Scenario**

**Formula:**
```
Annual Profit = (Revenue × Volume) - (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost × Volume + Risk Premium)
```

**Country X (High Demand):**
```
Annual Profit = ($250 × 200,000) - ($5M + $100 × 200,000 + $2M)
              = $50M - $27M = $23M
```

**Complete Calculations:**

| **Location** | **Demand** | **Annual Profit** |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| Country X | High | $23M |
| Country X | Medium | $15.5M |
| Country X | Low | $8M |
| Country Y | High | $18M |
| Country Y | Medium | $11M |
| Country Y | Low | $4M |
| Domestic | High | $12M |
| Domestic | Medium | $5.5M |
| Domestic | Low | ($1M) loss |

---

**Step 2: Calculate NPV for Each Path**

**NPV Formula:**
```
NPV = -Setup Cost + Σ[Annual Profit_t / (1.1)^t]  for t=1 to 10
```

**Simplified (using annuity factor for 10 years at 10%: 6.145):**
```
NPV = -Setup Cost + (Annual Profit × 6.145)
```

**Example for Country X, High Demand:**
```
NPV = -$20M + ($23M × 6.145) = -$20M + $141.3M = $121.3M
```

**Complete NPV Calculations:**

| **Location** | **Demand** | **Probability** | **NPV** |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Country X | High | 0.3 | $121.3M |
| Country X | Medium | 0.5 | $75.2M |
| Country X | Low | 0.2 | $29.2M |
| Country Y | High | 0.3 | $85.6M |
| Country Y | Medium | 0.5 | $42.6M |
| Country Y | Low | 0.2 | ($0.4M) |
| Domestic | High | 0.3 | $43.7M |
| Domestic | Medium | 0.5 | $3.8M |
| Domestic | Low | 0.2 | ($36.1M) |

---

**Step 3: Calculate Expected NPV for Each Location**

**Country X:**
```
Expected NPV = (0.3 × $121.3M) + (0.5 × $75.2M) + (0.2 × $29.2M)
             = $36.4M + $37.6M + $5.8M = $79.8M
```

**Country Y:**
```
Expected NPV = (0.3 × $85.6M) + (0.5 × $42.6M) + (0.2 × -$0.4M)
             = $25.7M + $21.3M - $0.08M = $46.9M
```

**Domestic:**
```
Expected NPV = (0.3 × $43.7M) + (0.5 × $3.8M) + (0.2 × -$36.1M)
             = $13.1M + $1.9M - $7.2M = $7.8M
```

---

**Step 4: Decision**

**Expected NPV Comparison:**
- **Country X: $79.8M** (Highest)
- Country Y: $46.9M
- Domestic: $7.8M

**Recommendation:** Build in Country X for maximum expected value.

**However, consider:**

**Risk Assessment:**
- Country X has highest upside but also lowest worst-case ($29.2M)
- Domestic has potential loss in low demand scenario (-$36.1M)
- Country Y more balanced

**Risk Tolerance:**
- **Risk-seeking**: Choose Country X (highest expected value)
- **Risk-averse**: Might choose Country Y (no negative outcomes, reasonable return)
- **Very risk-averse**: Avoid domestic (potential loss)

**Additional Considerations:**
- Political risk in Country X beyond modeled premium
- Flexibility to expand or contract
- Strategic importance of each market

### 4.6.4 Sensitivity Analysis on Decision Trees

Test how changes in assumptions affect the decision:

**Sensitivity 1: Probability Changes**

What if high demand probability increases to 40% (medium decreases to 40%)?

**Recalculated Expected NPV:**
- Country X: (0.4 × $121.3M) + (0.4 × $75.2M) + (0.2 × $29.2M) = $84.4M
- Country Y: (0.4 × $85.6M) + (0.4 × $42.6M) + (0.2 × -$0.4M) = $51.2M
- Domestic: (0.4 × $43.7M) + (0.4 × $3.8M) + (0.2 × -$36.1M) = $11.8M

**Result:** Country X still preferred, advantage increased.

---

**Sensitivity 2: Cost Changes**

What if Country X variable cost increases to $110/unit (due to wage inflation)?

**Recalculated Annual Profits:**
- High: $21M, Medium: $13.5M, Low: $6M

**New NPV:**
- High: $109M, Medium: $63M, Low: $16.9M

**New Expected NPV:**
(0.3 × $109M) + (0.5 × $63M) + (0.2 × $16.9M) = $67.6M

**Result:** Country X still preferred but advantage narrowed (was $79.8M, now $67.6M).

---

**Sensitivity 3: Risk Premium**

What if Country X political risk premium doubles to $4M/year?

**Recalculated Annual Profits:**
- High: $21M, Medium: $13.5M, Low: $6M

**New Expected NPV:** $67.6M

**Result:** Similar to cost increase; still preferred but closer competition.

---

**Break-Even Analysis:**

At what Country X variable cost does Country Y become preferred?

Set Expected NPV equal:
```
Country X Expected NPV = Country Y Expected NPV
Solve for variable cost
```

Through iteration or algebra: Break-even at approximately $127/unit

**Interpretation:** Country X remains best choice unless costs rise more than 27%.

---

### 4.6.5 Sequential Decision Trees

More complex situations involve multiple decisions over time.

**Example: Build Now vs. Wait**

**Decision 1 (Today):** Build facility now or wait 2 years?
**Uncertain Event:** Market test results after 1 year (favorable or unfavorable)
**Decision 2 (Year 2):** If waited, build or don't build based on test results?

```
                     Favorable (0.6)
                   ○──────────▶ Build □──▶ High Demand ○
                   │                            │
       Build Now   │                            └──▶ Low Demand ○
           □───────┤
           │       │  Unfavorable (0.4)
           │       └──────────▶ High Demand ○
           │                            │
           │                            └──▶ Low Demand ○
           │
           │       Favorable (0.6)            Build □──▶ Outcomes
           │     ○──────────▶ Test Results ○────────│
       Wait│     │                               Don't Build
           │─────┤
                 │  Unfavorable (0.4)          Build □──▶ Outcomes
                 └──────────▶ Test Results ○────────│
                                                 Don't Build
```

**Value of Waiting:**
- Gain information before committing
- Can avoid building if market unfavorable
- But delay means lost profit opportunity in years 1-2

**Analysis:**
1. Calculate NPV for each final outcome
2. Work backward:
   - At Year 2 decision: Choose build or don't build based on expected value
   - At Year 0 decision: Compare "build now" vs. expected value of "wait" strategy

**Result:** Wait if value of information > cost of delay

- NPV of profits (considering growth): $4,950M
- **Net NPV: $4,650M**

---

### 4.7.5 Risk Consideration

**Uncertainty: Asia Market Demand**

Demand could be:
- **High** (40% probability): 6M tires/year initially
- **Base** (40% probability): 4M tires/year initially
- **Low** (20% probability): 2M tires/year initially

**Decision Tree Analysis for Option 2:**

```
                                High Demand (0.4)
                              ○──────────▶ NPV = $5,800M
          Build Regional     │
   AM Tires ──────□──────────│  Base Demand (0.4)
          Plants             ○──────────▶ NPV = $4,830M
                             │
                             └─ Low Demand (0.2)
                               ──────────▶ NPV = $3,500M
```

**Expected NPV:**
= (0.4 × $5,800M) + (0.4 × $4,830M) + (0.2 × $3,500M)
= $2,320M + $1,932M + $700M = **$4,952M**

**Comparison with Option 1 (more certain):**
Option 1 Expected NPV: $3,700M (stable, less dependent on Asia demand)

**Risk-Return Trade-off:**
- Option 2 higher expected return but more variable
- Option 1 lower return but less risk
- Decision depends on risk tolerance

---

### 4.7.6 Additional Strategic Considerations

**1. Market Positioning**
- Local production in Asia signals commitment
- Better relationships with customers and governments
- Option 2 preferred for long-term market leadership

**2. Geopolitical Risk**
- Trade tensions could increase tariffs (hurts Option 1)
- Local presence reduces exposure
- Regional plants provide flexibility

**3. Responsiveness**
- Asian market fast-changing (automotive, technology)
- Local plants enable faster response
- Option 2 advantage

**4. Learning and Innovation**
- Proximity to Asian manufacturing ecosystems
- Access to innovations and suppliers
- Supports Option 2

**5. Complexity**
- Multiple plants increase coordination challenges
- Cultural and language barriers
- Option 1 simpler to manage

---

### 4.7.7 Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation: Option 2 (Regional Plants)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Highest expected NPV** ($4,830M base case, $4,952M considering uncertainty)
2. **Strategic positioning** in growth markets
3. **Risk mitigation** through geographic diversification
4. **Responsiveness** to local market needs
5. **Long-term competitive advantage** despite higher initial investment

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (Years 1-2)**: Build China plant
2. **Phase 2 (Years 2-3)**: Monitor Asia market, build Poland plant
3. **Sequential approach** reduces risk, allows learning

**Contingency:**
- If Asia demand disappoints in first 2 years, delay or downsize Poland investment
- Maintain flexibility in contracts and design

## 4.8 Making Decisions Under Uncertainty in Practice

Beyond formal decision trees, managers must deal with uncertainty in practical ways.

### 4.8.1 Sources of Uncertainty in Global Networks

**1. Demand Uncertainty**
- Volume, mix, timing, location
- New product adoption rates
- Competitive actions

**2. Cost Uncertainty**
- Labor cost inflation
- Exchange rate movements
- Transportation cost volatility
- Commodity prices

**3. Regulatory Uncertainty**
- Tariff changes
- Environmental regulations
- Labor laws
- Trade agreements

**4. Technology Uncertainty**
- Process innovations
- Automation advances
- Digital disruption

**5. Disruption Uncertainty**
- Natural disasters
- Pandemics
- Political instability
- Infrastructure failures

---

### 4.8.2 Practical Decision-Making Approaches

**Approach 1: Scenario Planning**

Develop 3-5 distinct future scenarios and evaluate options against each.

**Example Scenarios:**
1. **Globalization Continues**: Free trade, stable politics, low tariffs
2. **Regionalization**: Trade blocs strengthen, moderate tariffs, regional focus
3. **Deglobalization**: High tariffs, trade wars, reshoring trend
4. **Disruption Era**: Frequent disruptions, climate change impacts, supply volatility

**For each scenario:**
- Describe key characteristics
- Assess likelihood (approximate)
- Evaluate each network option's performance
- Identify no-regret moves (good in all scenarios) and hedges

---

**Approach 2: Real Options Thinking**

Structure decisions to maintain flexibility:

**Option to Defer:**
- Delay commitment until uncertainty resolves
- Pay for option (e.g., land option, preliminary contracts)

**Option to Expand:**
- Build smaller initially with expansion capability
- Exercise if demand materializes

**Option to Switch:**
- Design facilities for multiple products or markets
- Switch based on actual conditions

**Option to Abandon:**
- Exit strategy if things don't work out
- Lease vs. own decisions

**Example:**
> *Rather than building a 5M unit plant immediately, build 3M with expansion capability. This costs 10% more than building 5M upfront, but provides flexibility if demand disappoints.*

---

**Approach 3: Robust Decision-Making**

Focus on decisions that perform acceptably across many scenarios rather than optimizing for one.

**Steps:**
1. Identify candidate strategies
2. Test against wide range of scenarios (hundreds)
3. Evaluate robustness (how often does strategy succeed?)
4. Choose strategy with acceptable performance in most scenarios

**Example:**
- Strategy A: Optimal if demand high, fails if demand low
- Strategy B: Good (not optimal) across all scenarios
- **Choose B for robustness**

---

**Approach 4: Adaptive Decision-Making**

Make initial decision with planned review points:

**Framework:**
1. **Initial decision** based on current information
2. **Define signposts**: What would indicate conditions changing?
3. **Set review points**: When to reassess (annually, or trigger-based)
4. **Prepare contingencies**: Pre-developed alternative actions
5. **Execute adaptively**: Adjust as uncertainty resolves

**Example:**
> *Build plant in Country A. Review after 2 years. If demand growth <5%, consider downsizing. If demand growth >15%, accelerate expansion. If tariffs increase >10 percentage points, evaluate alternative locations.*

---

**Approach 5: Portfolio Approach**

Diversify across options rather than committing fully to one:

**Example:**
- 60% capacity in low-cost offshore location
- 30% capacity in nearshore location
- 10% capacity retained domestically

**Benefits:**
- Hedges against various risks
- Maintains flexibility
- Enables learning from multiple approaches

**Cost:**
- Less optimal than single best option if conditions certain
- Complexity of managing multiple facilities

### 4.8.4 Balancing Analysis and Judgment

**Role of Formal Analysis:**
- Structure the problem
- Identify trade-offs
- Quantify where possible
- Test sensitivity

**Role of Managerial Judgment:**
- Assess qualitative factors
- Incorporate experience and intuition
- Consider factors difficult to quantify
- Make final decision accepting uncertainty

**Best Practice:** Use analysis to inform, not replace, judgment.

---

### 4.8.5 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Overconfidence in Forecasts**
- Single-point estimates rarely accurate
- Use ranges and scenarios

**2. Anchoring on Current Conditions**
- Don't assume future like past
- Consider structural changes

**3. Analysis Paralysis**
- Waiting for perfect information
- Sometimes must decide with incomplete data

**4. Ignoring Implementation Challenges**
- Focus only on financial analysis
- Underestimate execution difficulty

**5. Failure to Monitor and Adapt**
- "Set and forget" approach
- Conditions change, decisions must too

**6. Optimizing Local Subproblems**
- Facility location separate from sourcing decision
- Must optimize total system

---

## 4.9 Chapter Summary

This chapter has explored the complexities of designing global supply chain networks, focusing on the opportunities, challenges, risks, and decision-making approaches.

### **Key Concepts:**

**1. Globalization Impact**
- Creates cost and market access opportunities
- Increases complexity, lead times, and risks
- Requires total landed cost perspective, not just purchase price
- Different network configurations (global consolidation, regional, multi-domestic, hybrid)

**2. Offshoring Decisions**
- Must evaluate using comprehensive total cost approach
- Include direct, indirect, and hidden costs
- Consider qualitative factors (quality, responsiveness, innovation, risk)
- Reshoring trends emerging due to rising costs, risks, and technology

**3. Risk Management**
- Multiple risk categories: operational, financial, geopolitical, natural disaster, security, compliance, IP
- Systematic risk assessment (identify, assess probability and impact, prioritize)
- Strategies: avoidance, mitigation, transfer, acceptance, pooling, resilience
- Integrated approach with continuous monitoring

**4. Evaluation of Global Designs**
- Multiple dimensions: financial, operational, strategic, risk, sustainability
- Balanced scorecard approach
- Comparative evaluation of alternatives
- Scenario analysis for robustness

**5. Decision Trees**
- Structured framework for decisions under uncertainty
- Components: decision nodes, chance nodes, probabilities, payoffs
- Calculate expected values working backward
- Sensitivity analysis to test assumptions
- Sequential decisions model multiple decisions over time

**6. Practical Decision-Making**
- Scenario planning for strategic flexibility
- Real options thinking for maintaining flexibility
- Robust decision-making for acceptable performance across scenarios
- Adaptive approach with monitoring and adjustment
- Portfolio diversification across multiple options

### **Critical Takeaways:**

- **Lowest price ≠ lowest cost**: Total landed cost is the proper metric
- **Balance efficiency and resilience**: Ultra-lean global networks are vulnerable
- **Risk is real and must be managed**: Systematic approach to identification and mitigation
- **Uncertainty requires flexibility**: Build options and adaptability into designs
- **Analysis informs judgment**: Use formal tools but recognize limits
- **Continuous monitoring essential**: Global conditions change rapidly, networks must adapt
- **Strategic alignment critical**: Network design must support overall business strategy
