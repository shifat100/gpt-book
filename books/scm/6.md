## 6.1 Introduction to Aggregate Planning

**Aggregate planning** is the process of developing a medium-term (typically 3-18 months) operational plan that determines production levels, workforce levels, inventory levels, and other resource requirements to meet anticipated demand while minimizing costs.

### 6.1.1 What is "Aggregate" Planning?

The term "aggregate" refers to planning at a consolidated level rather than individual products.

**Aggregation Dimensions:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  • Laptops      • Monthly     • Total labor hours
    (not specific • Quarterly   • Machine capacity
     models)                    • Total inventory

  Instead of:    Instead of:   Instead of:
  • Model X123   • Daily       • Worker A, B, C
  • Config ABC   • Hourly      • Machine 1, 2, 3
```

**Example:**

**Individual Level (NOT aggregate):**
- Production schedule for Model X123 in red color on Tuesday in Factory 1 on Machine 5

**Aggregate Level:**
- Total laptop production in Q3 across all factories

**Why Aggregate?**
- Reduces complexity (thousands of SKUs → dozens of product families)
- Enables strategic focus on capacity and resources
- Provides stable framework for detailed scheduling
- Forecasts more accurate at aggregate level

### 6.1.2 Position in Planning Hierarchy

Aggregate planning sits between strategic and operational planning:

```

```

**Key Relationships:**
- **Strategic plans** set constraints (total capacity, facility locations)
- **Aggregate plans** implement strategy within those constraints
- **Detailed schedules** execute aggregate plans at operational level

## 6.2 The Role of Aggregate Planning in Supply Chains

### 6.2.1 Strategic Role

**1. Translating Strategy to Operations**

Aggregate planning converts high-level business strategy into actionable operational plans.

**Example:**
> *Business Strategy: "Grow market share by maintaining 98% service level"*
> 
> *Aggregate Plan: "Increase production capacity 15% through overtime and temporary workers to build safety stock ahead of peak season"*

**2. Balancing Supply and Demand**

Core function: Match production capacity with demand forecasts over medium-term horizon.

**Challenge:** Demand varies but capacity is relatively fixed in short term.

**Aggregate Planning Solution:** Use various levers (inventory, workforce, overtime, subcontracting) to balance supply and demand cost-effectively.

---

**3. Resource Optimization**

Optimize use of constrained resources:
- **Labor**: Hiring, firing, overtime, idle time
- **Capacity**: Equipment utilization, plant hours
- **Inventory**: Working capital, storage space
- **Supply chain**: Supplier capacity, transportation

---

**4. Cost Management**

Aggregate planning directly impacts major cost categories:

| **Cost Category** | **Aggregate Planning Impact** |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Labor costs** | Workforce sizing, overtime vs. regular time, hiring/layoff decisions |
| **Inventory costs** | Carrying costs, obsolescence risk, working capital |
| **Capacity costs** | Equipment utilization, subcontracting expenses |
| **Shortage costs** | Lost sales, backorders, expediting |
| **Change costs** | Production rate changes, workforce adjustments |

---

### 6.2.2 Operational Benefits

**1. Improved Coordination**

- Aligns production, procurement, logistics, and sales
- Provides common framework for decision-making
- Facilitates cross-functional communication

**2. Better Resource Utilization**

- Smooths production rates
- Reduces capacity waste
- Optimizes inventory investment

**3. Enhanced Customer Service**

- Ensures product availability
- Reduces stockouts and backorders
- Enables reliable delivery promises

**4. Financial Planning Support**

- Provides basis for budgets
- Projects working capital needs
- Supports financial forecasts

---

### 6.2.3 Typical Planning Horizon

**Time Frame:** 3-18 months, typically 6-12 months

**Why This Horizon?**

**Too Short (< 3 months):**
- Limited ability to adjust capacity
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Cannot take advantage of lead times

**Too Long (> 18 months):**
- Forecasts too inaccurate
- Too much uncertainty
- Better suited to strategic planning

**Period Length:** Usually monthly, sometimes weekly or quarterly

**Rolling Horizon:** Plan updated regularly (monthly) as new information becomes available

```

## 6.3 The Aggregate Planning Problem

### 6.3.1 Problem Definition

**Given:**
- Demand forecast for each period
- Current resource levels (workforce, inventory, capacity)
- Costs for various options (regular time, overtime, hiring, inventory, etc.)
- Constraints (maximum capacity, minimum service levels, etc.)

**Find:**
- Production quantities each period
- Workforce levels each period
- Inventory levels each period
- Use of other options (overtime, subcontracting)

**Objective:**
- Minimize total costs OR
- Maximize profit/service level subject to cost constraints

---

### 6.3.2 Key Decision Variables

**1. Production Quantity (P_t)**
- How many units to produce in period t?
- Regular time production
- Overtime production
- Subcontracted production

**2. Workforce Level (W_t)**
- How many workers to employ in period t?
- Hiring decisions
- Layoff decisions

**3. Inventory Level (I_t)**
- Ending inventory in period t
- Safety stock levels
- Backorders (if allowed)

**4. Other Variables**
- Overtime hours
- Subcontracting quantities
- Machine time usage

---

### 6.3.3 Cost Components

**1. Production Costs**

**Regular Time Production:**
- Direct labor at regular wages
- Materials
- Variable overhead

**Overtime Production:**
- Labor at premium rate (typically 1.5× regular)
- Same material costs

**Subcontracting:**
- Usually highest per-unit cost
- No internal labor or capacity used

---

**2. Workforce Costs**

**Hiring Costs:**
- Recruitment and screening
- Training
- Administrative processing
- Reduced productivity during learning period

**Typical cost:** $1,000 - $5,000 per worker

**Layoff/Firing Costs:**
- Severance pay
- Administrative costs
- Unemployment insurance impact
- Potential legal costs
- Morale impact on remaining workers

**Typical cost:** $2,000 - $10,000 per worker

---

**3. Inventory Costs**

**Carrying Costs:**
- Capital cost (opportunity cost of money tied up)
- Storage and warehouse costs
- Insurance
- Obsolescence and shrinkage
- Handling costs

**Typical annual rate:** 20-30% of inventory value

**Monthly carrying cost = (Inventory value × Annual rate) / 12**

**Example:**
> *Product value: $100*
> *Annual carrying rate: 24%*
> *Monthly carrying cost: $100 × 0.24 / 12 = $2 per unit per month*

---

**4. Shortage Costs**

**Backorder Costs:**
- Administrative costs of managing backorders
- Expediting costs
- Customer goodwill loss

**Lost Sales Costs:**
- Lost revenue and profit
- Potential long-term customer loss
- Market share impact

**Note:** Shortage costs often difficult to quantify precisely

---

**5. Other Costs**

**Machine/Equipment Costs:**
- Depreciation
- Maintenance
- Utilities

**Change Costs:**
- Cost of changing production rates
- Setup and changeover costs
- Learning curve effects

---

### 6.3.4 Constraints

**1. Capacity Constraints**

**Regular Time Capacity:**
$$P_t^{regular} \leq \text{Workers}_t \times \text{Hours per worker} \times \text{Production rate}$$

**Total Capacity (including overtime):**
$$P_t^{total} \leq \text{Maximum capacity including overtime and subcontracting}$$

---

**2. Workforce Constraints**

**Workforce Balance:**
$$\text{Workers}_t = \text{Workers}_{t-1} + \text{Hired}_t - \text{Laid off}_t$$

**Hiring Limits:**
$$\text{Hired}_t \leq \text{Maximum hiring rate}$$

**Minimum Workforce:**
$$\text{Workers}_t \geq \text{Minimum workforce level}$$

---

**3. Inventory Constraints**

**Inventory Balance:**
$$I_t = I_{t-1} + P_t - D_t$$

Where:
- $I_t$ = Ending inventory in period t
- $P_t$ = Production in period t
- $D_t$ = Demand in period t

**Non-negativity (if backorders not allowed):**
$$I_t \geq 0$$

**Safety Stock Requirement:**
$$I_t \geq \text{Safety stock target}$$

**Storage Capacity:**
$$I_t \leq \text{Maximum warehouse capacity}$$

---

**4. Service Level Constraints**

**Fill Rate:**
$$\frac{\text{Demand met from stock}}{\text{Total demand}} \geq \text{Target fill rate}$$

**Maximum Backorders:**
$$\text{Backorders}_t \leq \text{Maximum allowed backorders}$$

---

### 6.3.5 Mathematical Formulation

**Basic Aggregate Planning Model:**

**Objective Function:**

$$\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=1}^{T} [C_p^r P_t^r + C_p^o P_t^o + C_h H_t + C_l L_t + C_i I_t + C_b B_t]$$

Where:
- $T$ = Number of periods in planning horizon
- $C_p^r$ = Regular time production cost per unit
- $P_t^r$ = Regular time production in period t
- $C_p^o$ = Overtime production cost per unit
- $P_t^o$ = Overtime production in period t
- $C_h$ = Cost per hire
- $H_t$ = Number of workers hired in period t
- $C_l$ = Cost per layoff
- $L_t$ = Number of workers laid off in period t
- $C_i$ = Inventory carrying cost per unit per period
- $I_t$ = Ending inventory in period t
- $C_b$ = Backorder cost per unit per period
- $B_t$ = Backorders in period t

**Subject to constraints** (capacity, inventory balance, workforce balance, etc.)

---

## 6.4 Aggregate Planning Strategies

Organizations use different strategies to match supply with demand. The three basic strategies are: Chase, Level, and Time Flexibility (Hybrid).

### 6.4.1 Chase Strategy

**Definition:** Adjust production each period to exactly match demand (inventory remains constant).

**Approach:**
- Production = Demand each period
- Workforce varies to achieve required production
- Hire when demand increases
- Lay off when demand decreases
- Minimal inventory (only safety stock)

**Visual Representation:**

```
Units
   │        Production
   │     (follows demand)

   │      ••••     ••••
   │  ••••             ••••
   │                      •••
   │━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ (Inventory stays constant)
   │
   └────────────────────────────▶ Time

**Example: Chase Strategy**

**Demand Forecast:**

| **Month** | **Demand (units)** |
|----------|-------------------|
| January | 1,000 |
| February | 1,200 |
| March | 1,500 |
| April | 1,800 |
| May | 1,600 |
| June | 1,300 |

**Assumptions:**
- Each worker produces 100 units per month
- Hiring cost: $1,000 per worker
- Layoff cost: $2,000 per worker
- Starting workforce: 10 workers
- Inventory carrying cost: $5/unit/month
- Target ending inventory: 200 units (constant)

**Chase Plan:**

| **Month** | **Demand** | **Production** | **Workers Needed** | **Workers Start** | **Hire** | **Layoff** | **End Inventory** |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|----------|------------------|
| Jan | 1,000 | 1,000 | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 200 |
| Feb | 1,200 | 1,200 | 12 | 10 | 2 | 0 | 200 |
| Mar | 1,500 | 1,500 | 15 | 12 | 3 | 0 | 200 |
| Apr | 1,800 | 1,800 | 18 | 15 | 3 | 0 | 200 |
| May | 1,600 | 1,600 | 16 | 18 | 0 | 2 | 200 |
| Jun | 1,300 | 1,300 | 13 | 16 | 0 | 3 | 200 |

**Cost Calculation:**

**Hiring Costs:**
- February: 2 workers × $1,000 = $2,000
- March: 3 workers × $1,000 = $3,000
- April: 3 workers × $1,000 = $3,000
- **Total hiring:** $8,000

**Layoff Costs:**
- May: 2 workers × $2,000 = $4,000
- June: 3 workers × $2,000 = $6,000
- **Total layoff:** $10,000

**Inventory Costs:**
- 200 units × 6 months × $5 = $6,000

**Total Additional Costs:** $8,000 + $10,000 + $6,000 = **$24,000**

(Plus production costs, which are the same across strategies)

**Example: Level Strategy**

Using same demand data as before:

| **Month** | **Demand (units)** |
|----------|-------------------|
| January | 1,000 |
| February | 1,200 |
| March | 1,500 |
| April | 1,800 |
| May | 1,600 |
| June | 1,300 |
| **Total** | **8,400** |

**Assumptions:**
- Average monthly production = 8,400 / 6 = 1,400 units
- Workers needed = 1,400 / 100 = 14 workers
- Starting inventory: 200 units
- Same costs as before

**Level Plan:**

| **Month** | **Demand** | **Production** | **Workers** | **Begin Inv** | **End Inv** | **Hire** | **Layoff** |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Jan | 1,000 | 1,400 | 14 | 200 | 600 | 4 | 0 |
| Feb | 1,200 | 1,400 | 14 | 600 | 800 | 0 | 0 |
| Mar | 1,500 | 1,400 | 14 | 800 | 700 | 0 | 0 |
| Apr | 1,800 | 1,400 | 14 | 700 | 300 | 0 | 0 |
| May | 1,600 | 1,400 | 14 | 300 | 100 | 0 | 0 |
| Jun | 1,300 | 1,400 | 14 | 100 | 200 | 0 | 0 |

**Cost Calculation:**

**Hiring Costs:**
- January: 4 workers × $1,000 = $4,000
- **Total hiring:** $4,000

**Layoff Costs:**
- None
- **Total layoff:** $0

**Inventory Costs:**
- January: 600 units × $5 = $3,000
- February: 800 units × $5 = $4,000
- March: 700 units × $5 = $3,500
- April: 300 units × $5 = $1,500
- May: 100 units × $5 = $500
- June: 200 units × $5 = $1,000
- **Total inventory:** $13,500

**Total Additional Costs:** $4,000 + $0 + $13,500 = **$17,500**

**Note:** Level strategy costs $17,500 vs. Chase strategy $24,000 – a savings of $6,500 in this example.

---

✗ **Cash flow impact**
- Capital tied up in inventory
- May require financing

**Best Suited For:**
- High workforce change costs (skilled labor, unions)
- Low inventory carrying costs
- Stable products (low obsolescence risk)
- Products with long shelf life
- Manufacturing with high setup costs

**Example Industries:**
- Automotive manufacturing

---

### 6.4.3 Time Flexibility (Hybrid) Strategy

**Definition:** Combine elements of chase and level strategies, using multiple levers to balance supply and demand.

**Approach:**
- Maintain relatively stable core workforce
- Use overtime during high-demand periods
- Use undertime/reduced hours during low-demand
- Allow some inventory fluctuation (but less than pure level)
- May use subcontracting for peak demand
- May allow limited backorders

**Flexibility Options:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       TIME FLEXIBILITY OPTIONS                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │

• Overtime      • Subcontract  • Pricing
• Undertime     • Temporary    • Promotions
• Cross-training  workers      • Backorders
• Shifts        • Outsourcing  • Pre-orders
• Part-time                    • Reservation
```

---

**Example: Hybrid Strategy**

Using same demand data:

**Assumptions:**
- Maintain stable workforce of 12 workers (1,200 units/month capacity)
- Use overtime (up to 20% extra capacity = 240 units)
- Overtime cost: 1.5× regular cost
- Allow some inventory buildup but less than level strategy
- Subcontracting available at premium cost if needed

**Hybrid Plan:**

| **Month** | **Demand** | **Regular Prod** | **Overtime Prod** | **Total Prod** | **Workers** | **End Inv** |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Jan | 1,000 | 1,200 | 0 | 1,200 | 12 | 400 |
| Feb | 1,200 | 1,200 | 0 | 1,200 | 12 | 400 |
| Mar | 1,500 | 1,200 | 240 | 1,440 | 12 | 340 |
| Apr | 1,800 | 1,200 | 240 | 1,440 | 12 | -20* |
| May | 1,600 | 1,200 | 240 | 1,440 | 12 | -180* |
| Jun | 1,300 | 1,200 | 100 | 1,300 | 12 | -180* |

*Negative inventory = backorders (customers wait)

**Cost Calculation:**

**Hiring Costs:**
- January: 2 workers × $1,000 = $2,000

**Overtime Costs:**
- March: 240 units × (1.5× regular – regular) = 240 × 0.5 × regular cost premium
- April: 240 units × premium
- May: 240 units × premium
- June: 100 units × premium

**Inventory Costs:**
- Carrying costs for positive inventory periods

**Backorder Costs:**
- Costs for negative inventory (backorders)

**Total costs would fall between Chase and Level strategies**

---

**Advantages of Hybrid Strategy:**

✓ **Balanced approach**
- Moderate inventory levels
- Stable core workforce with flexibility
- Reasonable costs

✓ **Good responsiveness**
- Can respond to demand changes without major workforce changes
- Overtime provides flexibility

✓ **Risk mitigation**
- Not overly dependent on inventory or workforce changes
- Multiple levers to adjust

✓ **Practical and realistic**
- Reflects real-world operations
- Politically acceptable

**Disadvantages of Hybrid Strategy:**

✗ **More complex to manage**
- Multiple variables to optimize
- Requires sophisticated planning tools

✗ **Moderate costs across categories**
- Some inventory costs
- Some overtime costs
- Some workforce change costs

✗ **Requires workforce flexibility**
- Workers must accept variable hours
- May face resistance from labor unions

**Best Suited For:**
- Most manufacturing situations
- Moderate demand variability
- Where overtime is feasible
- Organizations seeking balanced approach

### 6.4.5 Selecting the Appropriate Strategy

**Decision Framework:**

**Choose CHASE when:**
- Workforce easily adjusted (low-skill, contract labor available)
- High inventory carrying costs (perishable, high-value, fashion items)
- Highly seasonal demand
- Limited storage capacity
- Service industries

**Choose LEVEL when:**
- High workforce change costs (skilled labor, union contracts)
- Low inventory carrying costs (stable, low-value products)
- Relatively stable demand
- Long product life cycles
- High production changeover costs

**Choose HYBRID when:**
- Moderate costs and constraints
- Need balanced approach
- Multiple flexibility options available
- Most real-world manufacturing situations

**Quantitative Approach:**
- Model each strategy
- Calculate total costs
- Select strategy with lowest total cost
- Consider qualitative factors (morale, quality, risk)

### 6.6.3 Using Excel for Scenario Analysis

**Method 1: Manual "What-If" Analysis**

1. Create base scenario
2. Save as "Chase Strategy"
3. Manually adjust decision variables
4. Observe impact on costs
5. Save as "Level Strategy"
6. Compare totals

---

**Method 2: Excel Data Tables**

Create a table that automatically calculates costs for different workforce levels:

```
      Constant Workforce Level
         10      12      14      16
Total
Cost   $750K   $711K   $685K   $720K
```

**Steps:**
1. Set up one-way or two-way data table
2. Use Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table
3. Excel automatically calculates scenarios

---

**Method 3: Excel Solver (Optimization)**

Use Excel's Solver add-in to find optimal plan:

**Steps:**

1. **Set Objective:**
   - Cell: Total Cost (H84)
   - Goal: Minimize

2. **By Changing Variables:**
   - Production quantities (B35:G37)
   - Workforce levels (B41:G41)

3. **Subject to Constraints:**
   - Production ≤ Capacity
   - Inventory ≥ 0 (if backorders not allowed)
   - Workforce changes = Hired - Laid off
   - Non-negativity

4. **Solve:**
   - Solver finds optimal values
   - May not find global optimum (complex problem)

---

### 6.6.4 Excel Best Practices for Aggregate Planning

**1. Structure and Organization**

✓ Separate inputs from calculations
✓ Use clear section headers
✓ Color-code: inputs (yellow), calculations (white), outputs (green)
✓ Add comments to complex formulas

**2. Formula Best Practices**

✓ Use named ranges instead of cell references
```
Good: = Demand * RegularCost
Bad:  = B28 * $B$4
```

✓ Use absolute references ($) for parameters
✓ Build complex formulas step-by-step
✓ Use helper columns for intermediate calculations

**3. Error Checking**

✓ Include capacity utilization checks
✓ Verify inventory balance (production - demand = inventory change)
✓ Check workforce balance (start + hired - laid off = end)
✓ Use conditional formatting to highlight violations

**Example:**
```
Highlight cells where inventory < 0 (if backorders not allowed)
Highlight cells where utilization > 100% (capacity exceeded)
```

**4. Documentation**

✓ Document assumptions clearly
✓ Explain any unusual formulas
✓ Include version and date
✓ Note data sources for demand forecast

**5. Sensitivity Analysis**

✓ Test different demand scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic)
✓ Vary key cost parameters (±20%)
✓ Identify which costs have biggest impact

## 6.9 Economic Theory and Practice Aberrations

Real-world aggregate planning often deviates from theoretical optimization due to various practical considerations.

### 6.9.1 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Logic

**Theory:** Produce in batches that minimize total of setup and holding costs.

**EOQ Formula:**

$$Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}$$

Where:
- $D$ = Annual demand
- $S$ = Setup/ordering cost
- $H$ = Annual holding cost per unit

**Implication for Aggregate Planning:**
- Large production batches preferred when setup costs are high
- Conflicts with just-in-time (JIT) and level loading principles

---

**Practice Aberrations:**

**1. JIT Philosophy**
- Small batch sizes despite EOQ logic
- Focus on setup cost reduction rather than larger batches
- Toyota Production System influence

**Why the deviation?**
- Flexibility more valuable than cost minimization
- Hidden costs of large batches (quality, responsiveness)
- Setup cost reduction achievable through process improvement

---

**2. Seasonal Production Decisions**

**Theory:** Build inventory during low-demand periods to level production

**Practice Issues:**
- Actual demand may differ significantly from forecast
- Inventory obsolescence risk
- Cash flow concerns
- Storage capacity limits

**Example:**
> *Toy manufacturer faces decision: Build for Christmas in June-September (level production) or wait until September-November (chase)?*
> 
> *Theory says: Level production*
> *Practice: Many wait due to fashion risk, new product introductions, promotional uncertainty*

---

### 6.9.2 Labor Economics

**Theory:** Hire and fire based on pure cost optimization

**Practice Considerations:**

**1. Labor Market Frictions**
- Cannot instantly hire qualified workers
- Training takes time (learning curve)
- Recruitment costs higher than models assume
- Layoffs damage morale and reputation

**2. Labor Regulations**
- Minimum wage laws
- Overtime regulations
- Union contracts specifying terms
- Advance notice requirements for layoffs
- Severance requirements

**3. Social Responsibility**
- Corporate values around employment stability
- Community relationships
- Employer brand and recruitment

**Result:** Companies often maintain more stable workforce than pure optimization would suggest

---

### 6.9.3 Inventory Economics

**Theory:** Carry inventory to minimize total costs

**Practice Aberrations:**

**1. Working Capital Pressure**
- Finance often imposes inventory targets below optimal
- Cash flow concerns override cost minimization
- End-of-quarter inventory reduction drives

**2. Obsolescence Risk Not Fully Captured**
- Models use average carrying cost
- Actual obsolescence risk varies by product
- Fashion, technology products have much higher risk

**3. Storage Space Constraints**
- Warehouse capacity often binding constraint
- Not all products can be stored everywhere
- Practical handling and rotation issues

---

### 6.9.4 Capacity Flexibility

**Theory:** Overtime, subcontracting provide perfect flexibility at known costs

**Practice Realities:**

**1. Overtime Limitations**
- Worker fatigue reduces productivity
- Quality issues increase
- Labor law limits on hours
- Worker resistance to sustained overtime

**2. Subcontracting Challenges**
- Limited availability of qualified subcontractors
- Quality control difficulties
- Intellectual property concerns
- Lead times to set up subcontracting
- Minimum order quantities

**3. Temporary Workers**
- Quality and productivity lower than permanent staff
- Training time and cost
- Legal and HR complications
- Integration challenges

---

### 6.9.5 Demand Management

**Theory:** Demand is exogenous (given, cannot be influenced)

**Practice:** Demand can be shaped through:

**1. Pricing Actions**
- Discounts during low-demand periods
- Premiums during peaks
- Early-bird specials
- Off-peak pricing

**Example:**
> *Hotel offers 30% discount for mid-week stays (Tuesday-Thursday) to smooth demand*

**2. Promotional Timing**
- Schedule promotions during low-demand periods
- Coordinate with production capacity

**3. Product Allocation**
- Prioritize high-margin products during constrained periods
- Push lower-margin products when capacity available

**4. Lead Time Management**
- Longer lead times during busy periods
- Express options at premium price

---

### 6.9.6 Behavioral Considerations

**Theory:** Rational, objective decision-making

**Practice:**

**1. Political Dynamics**
- Sales overstates demand to ensure product availability
- Operations understates capacity to avoid commitments
- Gaming the planning process

**Solution:** Separate forecasting from planning, measure accuracy

**2. Anchoring Bias**
- Plans anchor on previous period
- Insufficient adjustment for changing conditions

**Solution:** Zero-based planning periodically

**3. Optimism Bias**
- Overestimate ability to execute
- Underestimate problems and delays

**Solution:** Probabilistic planning, contingency planning

**4. Risk Aversion**
- Preference for "safe" options over optimal but uncertain ones
- Excess inventory "just in case"

**Solution:** Explicit risk quantification, management commitment

---

## 6.10 Chapter Summary

Aggregate planning is a critical tactical planning process that translates strategic direction into operational reality, balancing supply and demand over a medium-term horizon while optimizing resource utilization and costs.

### **Key Concepts:**

**1. Role and Definition**
- Medium-term planning (3-18 months) at aggregate level
- Determines production, workforce, and inventory levels
- Links strategic plans to detailed schedules
- Optimizes costs while meeting demand

**2. The Planning Problem**
- **Given:** Demand forecast, costs, constraints
- **Find:** Production quantities, workforce levels, inventory positions
- **Objective:** Minimize total costs OR maximize service/profit
- **Key trade-offs:** Workforce costs vs. inventory costs vs. shortage costs

**3. Strategic Approaches**

**Chase Strategy:**
- Match production to demand
- Variable workforce
- Minimal inventory
- Best for: Low-skill labor, seasonal demand, high carrying costs

**Level Strategy:**
- Constant workforce and production
- Use inventory to buffer demand
- Best for: Skilled labor, low carrying costs, stable products

**Hybrid/Time Flexibility:**
- Stable core workforce + overtime/subcontracting
- Moderate inventory fluctuation
- Best for: Most real-world situations
- Balanced costs and risks

**4. Excel-Based Planning**
- Structure: Parameters → Demand → Decisions → Calculations → Costs
- Use named ranges, clear formulas
- Scenario analysis and what-if testing
- Solver for optimization
- Discipline in structure and documentation

**5. Role of IT**
- ERP systems: Integration, automation, workflow
- APS systems: Optimization, scenarios, multi-echelon
- AI/ML: Enhanced forecasting, automated recommendations
- Digital twins: Simulation and continuous optimization
- Balance technology capability with human judgment

**6. Implementation Through S&OP**
- Monthly planning cycle
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Executive decision-making
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment

**7. Practice vs. Theory**
- Real world has constraints theory ignores
- Labor market frictions, regulations
- Working capital pressure
- Behavioral and political dynamics
- Demand can be managed, not just accepted

### **Critical Takeaways:**

- **No single "best" strategy** – optimal approach depends on costs, constraints, and business context
- **Quantitative analysis essential** but must be supplemented with judgment
- **Excel provides accessible starting point** for aggregate planning
- **Technology enables sophistication** but requires data quality and organizational readiness
- **Cross-functional collaboration critical** – S&OP process essential
- **Theory provides framework** but practice requires adaptation to real-world complexities
- **Continuous improvement mindset** – plan, execute, measure, learn, refine
