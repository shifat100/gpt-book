## 7.1 Introduction: The Role of Inventory in Supply Chains

### 7.1.1 What is Inventory?

**Inventory** refers to the stock of goods and materials held by an organization to meet customer demand, support production, or buffer against uncertainty.

**Formal Definition:**

> *"Inventory is the accumulation of raw materials, components, work-in-process, and finished goods that appear at various points throughout a firm's production and logistics channel."*

### 7.1.2 Why Companies Hold Inventory

Despite the costs associated with inventory, companies maintain stock for several critical reasons:

**1. Meet Customer Demand:**
- Ensure product availability when customers want to purchase
- Avoid lost sales due to stockouts
- Enable immediate fulfillment

**Example:** A pharmacy stocks common medicines to serve customers immediately rather than ordering upon request.

**2. Smooth Production:**
- Decouple different stages of production
- Enable continuous operations despite variations in supply or demand
- Allow for economical production runs

**Example:** An automobile manufacturer maintains inventory of engines produced in one plant to supply assembly operations in another.

**3. Hedge Against Uncertainty:**
- Protect against demand variability
- Buffer against supply disruptions
- Mitigate lead time uncertainty

**Example:** Retailers increase inventory before major holidays to avoid stockouts during unpredictable demand spikes.

**4. Achieve Economies of Scale:**
- Reduce per-unit costs through bulk purchasing
- Lower transportation costs per unit
- Optimize production setup costs

**Example:** A retailer orders larger quantities less frequently to negotiate volume discounts and reduce ordering costs.

**5. Enable Geographic Specialization:**
- Allow production in low-cost locations
- Enable centralized manufacturing
- Support global sourcing strategies

**Example:** Electronics companies manufacture in Asia and hold inventory in regional distribution centers to serve global markets.

### 7.1.3 The Inventory Dilemma

Companies face a fundamental tension:

```
TOO MUCH INVENTORY              TOO LITTLE INVENTORY
        ↓                               ↓
   High Costs                      Lost Sales
   Obsolescence                    Stockouts
   Storage Needs                   Customer Dissatisfaction
   Cash Tied Up                    Production Disruptions
        ↓                               ↓
    OPTIMAL INVENTORY LEVEL
           (The Balance)
```

**The Challenge:** Determining the right inventory level that minimizes total costs while maintaining desired service levels.

### 7.1.4 Types of Inventory

Organizations hold different types of inventory, each serving specific purposes:

| Inventory Type | Purpose | Characteristics | Example |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Cycle Inventory** | Meet expected demand | Regular replenishment, predictable | Base stock at retail stores |
| **Safety Inventory** | Buffer against uncertainty | Extra stock above expected demand | Emergency reserves |
| **Seasonal Inventory** | Meet predictable seasonal peaks | Built up before high-demand periods | Winter clothing in autumn |
| **Pipeline Inventory** | Goods in transit | Moving through supply chain | Products on ships, trucks |
| **Work-in-Process (WIP)** | Items being manufactured | Between production stages | Partially assembled products |
| **Maintenance/Repair** | Support operations | Spare parts, consumables | Machine replacement parts |

### 7.1.5 Inventory Costs

Understanding inventory costs is essential for optimization:

**1. Holding (Carrying) Costs:**

```
ANNUAL HOLDING COST = Average Inventory × Unit Cost × Holding Cost %
```

**Components:**
- **Capital cost:** Opportunity cost of money tied up (typically 10-25% annually)
- **Storage cost:** Warehouse space, rent, utilities
- **Insurance and taxes:** Risk protection and property taxes
- **Obsolescence:** Risk of product becoming outdated
- **Deterioration:** Physical degradation, spoilage

**Typical Range:** 20-35% of inventory value annually

**Example:** If a company holds $1 million in inventory and annual holding cost is 25%, the annual carrying cost is $250,000.

**2. Ordering (Setup) Costs:**

**For Retailers/Distributors:**
- Order processing costs
- Transportation costs
- Receiving and inspection
- Invoice processing and payment

**For Manufacturers:**
- Production setup costs
- Machine changeover time
- Quality testing
- Schedule coordination

**Typical Range:** $50-$500 per order/setup

**3. Stockout Costs:**

**Tangible:**
- Lost sales (immediate)
- Expediting costs (special orders, express shipping)
- Production stoppage costs

**Intangible:**
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Lost future sales
- Brand reputation damage

**Difficulty:** Often hardest to quantify precisely

### 7.1.6 Inventory Performance Metrics

**1. Inventory Turnover:**

```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (Annual) / Average Inventory Value
```

**Interpretation:**
- Higher turnover = Inventory moves quickly
- Lower turnover = Inventory sits longer

**Example:** COGS = $10 million, Average Inventory = $2 million
- Inventory Turnover = 10/2 = 5 times per year
- Each dollar of inventory is sold and replenished 5 times annually

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Grocery retail: 15-20 turns
- Apparel retail: 4-6 turns
- Automobile manufacturing: 8-12 turns
- Pharmaceuticals: 2-4 turns

**2. Days of Inventory:**

```
Days of Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover
```

or

```
Days of Inventory = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
```

**Example:** With turnover of 5, Days of Inventory = 365/5 = 73 days

**Interpretation:** On average, inventory stays in the system for 73 days.

**3. Fill Rate (Service Level):**

```
Fill Rate = Orders Filled Completely / Total Orders
```

or for units:

```
Fill Rate = Units Delivered / Units Ordered
```

**Example:** 95 out of 100 orders filled completely = 95% fill rate

**4. Stockout Frequency:**

```
Stockout Frequency = Number of Stockout Instances / Total Order Cycles
```

## 7.2 Economies of Scale in the Supply Chain

### 7.2.1 Understanding Economies of Scale

**Economies of scale** occur when the average cost per unit decreases as the quantity produced, transported, or purchased increases.

**Core Principle:**

```
UNIT COST
    ↑
    |     ╲
    |      ╲
    |       ╲___
    |           ‾‾‾‾‾___
    |                  ‾‾‾‾‾
    |________________________→ QUANTITY
    
Fixed costs spread over more units → Lower average cost
```

### 7.2.2 Sources of Economies of Scale

#### **1. Production Economies:**

**Fixed Setup Costs:**
- Machine setup and changeover time
- Quality testing and approval
- Production scheduling

**Example Calculation:**

```
Setup Cost: $1,000 per production run
Production: 100 units vs. 1,000 units

For 100 units:
Setup cost per unit = $1,000 / 100 = $10/unit

For 1,000 units:
Setup cost per unit = $1,000 / 1,000 = $1/unit

Savings: $9/unit by producing 10x quantity
```

**Material Utilization:**
- Reduced waste in larger batches
- Better resource allocation
- Continuous production efficiency

**Learning Effects:**
- Workers become more efficient with longer runs
- Less downtime between changeovers
- Quality improvements

#### **2. Procurement Economies:**

**Volume Discounts:**

Suppliers offer lower prices for larger orders:

| Order Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost | Savings |
|----------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1-99 units | $10.00 | $990 (99 units) | Base |
| 100-499 units | $9.50 | $950 (100 units) | 5% |
| 500-999 units | $9.00 | $4,500 (500 units) | 10% |
| 1,000+ units | $8.50 | $8,500 (1,000 units) | 15% |

**Reduced Transaction Costs:**
- Fewer purchase orders to process
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Lower payment processing costs

**Example:** 
- Processing cost per order: $75
- Ordering 100 units monthly: $75 × 12 = $900/year
- Ordering 1,200 units annually: $75 × 1 = $75/year
- Savings: $825/year in administrative costs

**Negotiation Power:**
- Larger buyers command better terms
- Access to preferential pricing
- Priority service and support

#### **3. Transportation Economies:**

**Fixed Transportation Costs:**

```
Full Truckload (FTL) vs. Less Than Truckload (LTL)

FTL: $2,000 for full truck (20,000 kg capacity)
Unit cost = $2,000 / 20,000 = $0.10/kg

LTL: $500 for 2,000 kg
Unit cost = $500 / 2,000 = $0.25/kg

Savings: $0.15/kg (60% reduction) by shipping full loads
```

**Consolidation Benefits:**
- Multiple small shipments combined
- Better vehicle utilization
- Reduced per-unit shipping costs

**Example Transportation Cost Structure:**

| Shipment Size | Cost | Per-Unit Cost (for 1 kg) |
|---------------|------|------------------------|
| Small parcel (10 kg) | $50 | $5.00/kg |
| LTL (500 kg) | $300 | $0.60/kg |
| FTL (10,000 kg) | $1,500 | $0.15/kg |
| Container (20,000 kg) | $2,000 | $0.10/kg |

**Container Utilization:**

```
UNDERUTILIZED (50%)          OPTIMIZED (95%)
Container cost: $2,000       Container cost: $2,000
Goods shipped: 10,000 kg     Goods shipped: 19,000 kg
Cost/kg: $0.20               Cost/kg: $0.105

Savings: $0.095/kg through better utilization
```

#### **4. Warehousing Economies:**

**Fixed Facility Costs:**
- Rent, utilities spread over more inventory
- Labor productivity improves with volume
- Equipment utilization increases

**Example:**

```
Warehouse monthly cost: $50,000
Scenario A: Handle 100,000 units
Cost per unit = $50,000 / 100,000 = $0.50

Scenario B: Handle 200,000 units (same facility)
Cost per unit = $50,000 / 200,000 = $0.25

Savings: $0.25/unit (50% reduction)
```

### 7.2.3 The Lot-Sizing Decision

**Trade-off Analysis:**

Larger lot sizes reduce per-unit costs but increase inventory holding costs:

```
TOTAL COST
    ↑
    |           Total Cost
    |              ╱‾╲
    |            ╱     ╲
    |          ╱         ╲
    |    Holding Cost ╱           ╲
    |              ╱                 ╲
    |            ╱                     
    |          ╱    
    |  Ordering/Setup Cost
    |   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾╲_______________
    |_____________________________________→
                    Optimal        QUANTITY
                    Order Quantity
```

**Key Insights:**

1. **Ordering/Setup Costs:** Decrease per unit as quantity increases
2. **Holding Costs:** Increase linearly with quantity
3. **Optimal Point:** Where total cost is minimized

### 7.2.4 Managing Economies of Scale

#### **Strategies to Capture Economies:**

**1. Order Consolidation:**

Combine orders from multiple products or locations:

```
BEFORE CONSOLIDATION:
Product A: 100 units → Truck 1 (50% full)
Product B: 100 units → Truck 2 (50% full)
Cost: 2 trucks × $1,000 = $2,000

AFTER CONSOLIDATION:
Products A + B: 200 units → Truck 1 (100% full)
Cost: 1 truck × $1,000 = $1,000
Savings: $1,000 (50%)
```

**2. Temporal Aggregation:**

Combine orders over time:

**Example:**
- Weekly ordering: 52 orders/year × $75 = $3,900
- Monthly ordering: 12 orders/year × $75 = $900
- Savings: $3,000 (77% reduction in ordering costs)

**Trade-off:** Higher average inventory with monthly orders

**3. Volume Commitments:**

Commit to larger volumes over time for better pricing:

```
STANDARD PRICING:
Buy 100 units monthly at $10/unit
Annual cost: 1,200 × $10 = $12,000

VOLUME CONTRACT:
Commit to 1,200 units annually at $9/unit
Annual cost: 1,200 × $9 = $10,800
Savings: $1,200 (10%)
```

**4. Third-Party Consolidation:**

Use distributors or consolidators:

```
DIRECT SHIPPING:
Manufacturer → 100 retailers (LTL rates)
Average cost: $0.50/unit

THROUGH DISTRIBUTOR:
Manufacturer → Distributor (FTL) → Retailers (regional delivery)
Average cost: $0.30/unit
Savings: 40%
```

### 7.2.5 Limitations and Risks

#### **When Economies of Scale Become Problematic:**

**1. Excess Inventory:**
- Ties up working capital
- Increases obsolescence risk
- Higher storage costs may offset procurement savings

**2. Reduced Flexibility:**
- Harder to respond to demand changes
- Increased risk with fashion/technology products
- Longer commitment periods

**3. Quality Issues:**
- Large batches hide quality problems
- Defects affect more units
- Harder to trace problems

**4. Demand Uncertainty:**
- Risk of overstock if demand drops
- Seasonal products particularly vulnerable

**Example Calculation:**

```
Volume discount decision:

OPTION A: Order 200 units quarterly
Unit price: $10
Quarterly cost: 200 × $10 = $2,000
Annual cost: $2,000 × 4 = $8,000
Average inventory: 100 units
Holding cost (25%): 100 × $10 × 0.25 = $250/year

OPTION B: Order 800 units annually
Unit price: $9 (10% discount)
Annual cost: 800 × $9 = $7,200
Average inventory: 400 units
Holding cost: 400 × $9 × 0.25 = $900/year

TOTAL COST COMPARISON:
Option A: $8,000 + $250 = $8,250
Option B: $7,200 + $900 = $8,100
Savings with B: $150

But: If 20% of annual order becomes obsolete in Option B:
Obsolescence cost: 800 × 0.20 × $9 = $1,440
Total cost B: $7,200 + $900 + $1,440 = $9,540
Option A is now better by $1,290
```

### 7.2.6 Balancing Economies of Scale

         ↓                           ↓
    BALANCED DECISION
```

## 7.3 Cycle Inventory

### 7.3.1 Definition and Concept

**Cycle inventory** (also called lot-size inventory) is the average inventory held to meet expected demand between replenishments.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Predictable and planned
- Directly related to order quantity
- Assumes deterministic demand
- Does not include safety stock

**Formula:**

```
Average Cycle Inventory = Order Quantity / 2
```

**Rationale:** If you order Q units and they arrive all at once, inventory starts at Q, decreases linearly to 0, then jumps back to Q.

**Graphical Representation:**

```
INVENTORY
    ↑
    |Q →  ┐
    |     │╲
    |     │  ╲
    |     │    ╲
    |Q/2 →│ AVG  ╲
    |     │        ╲
    |     │          ╲
    |0 →  └────────────┘→ Time
         ←─ Cycle ─→
```

### 7.3.2 The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model

The **EOQ model** determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs (ordering + holding).

#### **Model Assumptions:**

1. Demand is constant and known (e.g., 1,000 units/month)
2. Lead time is constant and known
3. Order arrives all at once (no partial deliveries)
4. No quantity discounts
5. No stockouts allowed
6. Ordering/setup cost is fixed per order
7. Holding cost is proportional to inventory level

#### **Notation:**

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit |
|--------|---------|------|
| **D** | Annual demand | units/year |
| **S** | Cost per order (or setup) | $/order |
| **H** | Annual holding cost per unit | $/unit/year |
| **C** | Unit purchase cost | $/unit |
| **Q** | Order quantity | units |
| **Q*** | Optimal order quantity (EOQ) | units |

#### **Cost Components:**

**1. Annual Ordering Cost:**

```
Annual Ordering Cost = (D/Q) × S
```

**Logic:** 
- If annual demand is D and order quantity is Q, we make D/Q orders per year
- Each order costs S
- Total = (Number of orders) × (Cost per order)

**Example:**
- D = 12,000 units/year
- Q = 1,000 units
- S = $100/order
- Annual ordering cost = (12,000/1,000) × $100 = 12 × $100 = $1,200

**2. Annual Holding Cost:**

```
Annual Holding Cost = (Q/2) × H
```

**Logic:**
- Average inventory = Q/2
- Each unit costs H per year to hold
- Total = (Average inventory) × (Holding cost per unit)

**Example:**
- Q = 1,000 units
- H = $5/unit/year
- Annual holding cost = (1,000/2) × $5 = 500 × $5 = $2,500

**3. Total Cost:**

```
Total Cost (TC) = Annual Ordering Cost + Annual Holding Cost
TC = (D/Q) × S + (Q/2) × H
```

#### **EOQ Formula Derivation:**

To minimize total cost, take the derivative with respect to Q and set to zero:

```
dTC/dQ = -DS/Q² + H/2 = 0

Solving for Q:
DS/Q² = H/2
Q² = 2DS/H
Q* = √(2DS/H)
```

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**

```
EOQ = Q* = √(2DS/H)
```

#### **Complete EOQ Example:**

**Given:**
- Annual demand (D) = 10,000 units
- Ordering cost (S) = $50/order
- Annual holding cost (H) = $4/unit/year

**Calculate EOQ:**

```
Q* = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 4)
Q* = √(1,000,000 / 4)
Q* = √250,000
Q* = 500 units
```

**Derived Metrics:**

**Number of orders per year:**
```
N = D/Q* = 10,000/500 = 20 orders/year
```

**Time between orders:**
```
T = Q*/D = 500/10,000 years = 0.05 years
T = 0.05 × 365 = 18.25 days
```

**Annual ordering cost:**
```
(D/Q*) × S = 20 × $50 = $1,000
```

**Annual holding cost:**
```
(Q*/2) × H = 250 × $4 = $1,000
```

**Total annual cost:**
```
TC = $1,000 + $1,000 = $2,000
```

**Key Insight:** At EOQ, annual ordering cost equals annual holding cost.

### 7.3.3 Sensitivity Analysis

EOQ is relatively insensitive to errors in parameter estimation:

**Example:** True EOQ = 500 units

| Order Quantity | Total Cost | % Above Minimum |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| 300 | $2,167 | 8.3% |
| 400 | $2,050 | 2.5% |
| **500 (EOQ)** | **$2,000** | **0%** |
| 600 | $2,017 | 0.8% |
| 700 | $2,057 | 2.9% |

**Interpretation:** Even with 40% error in order quantity (400 instead of 500), cost penalty is only 2.5%.

**Practical Implication:** 
- Don't over-optimize EOQ calculations
- Focus on accurate demand forecasting
- Round to convenient order quantities

### 7.3.4 EOQ Extensions and Variations

#### **1. EOQ with Quantity Discounts:**

Suppliers often offer price breaks for larger orders:

| Order Quantity | Unit Price |
|----------------|-----------|
| 0-999 | $10.00 |
| 1,000-2,999 | $9.50 |
| 3,000+ | $9.00 |

**Procedure:**

1. Calculate EOQ for each price level
2. If EOQ falls outside the price range, use the minimum quantity for that range
3. Calculate total cost (ordering + holding + purchase) for each feasible quantity
4. Select quantity with lowest total cost

**Example:**

**Given:**
- D = 10,000 units/year
- S = $50/order
- H = 25% of unit cost
- Price schedule as above

**Step 1: Calculate EOQ for each price:**

At $10.00: H = $10 × 0.25 = $2.50
```
EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 2.50) = 632 units
```
Feasible (within 0-999 range)

At $9.50: H = $9.50 × 0.25 = $2.375
```
EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 2.375) = 649 units
```
Not feasible (should be ≥1,000), use Q = 1,000

At $9.00: H = $9.00 × 0.25 = $2.25
```
EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 2.25) = 667 units
```
Not feasible (should be ≥3,000), use Q = 3,000

**Step 2: Calculate total costs:**

**Q = 632 units at $10.00:**
```
Purchase cost = 10,000 × $10.00 = $100,000
Ordering cost = (10,000/632) × $50 = $790
Holding cost = (632/2) × $2.50 = $790
Total = $101,580
```

**Q = 1,000 units at $9.50:**
```
Purchase cost = 10,000 × $9.50 = $95,000
Ordering cost = (10,000/1,000) × $50 = $500
Holding cost = (1,000/2) × $2.375 = $1,188
Total = $96,688
```

**Q = 3,000 units at $9.00:**
```
Purchase cost = 10,000 × $9.00 = $90,000
Ordering cost = (10,000/3,000) × $50 = $167
Holding cost = (3,000/2) × $2.25 = $3,375
Total = $93,542
```

**Decision:** Order 3,000 units to get the $9.00 price, saving $8,038 compared to EOQ.

#### **2. Economic Production Quantity (EPQ):**

For manufacturing where production and consumption occur simultaneously:

```
EPQ = √(2DS/H) × √(1/(1-d/p))

Where:
d = demand rate (units/day)
p = production rate (units/day)
```

**Difference from EOQ:** Production builds inventory gradually, not instantaneously.

**Example:**
- D = 10,000 units/year (27.4 units/day)
- p = 100 units/day
- S = $500/setup
- H = $5/unit/year

```
EPQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 500 / 5) × √(1/(1-27.4/100))
EPQ = √2,000,000 × √(1/0.726)
EPQ = 1,414 × 1.174
EPQ = 1,660 units
```

#### **3. Joint Replenishment:**

When multiple products are ordered from the same supplier:

```
Common order cycle for products sharing ordering costs
Individual product quantities still based on demand rates
```

**Benefit:** Reduce total ordering costs through consolidation

### 7.3.5 Managing Cycle Inventory in Practice

#### **Implementation Strategies:**

**1. ABC Analysis:**

Classify items by importance, apply different inventory policies:

| Class | % of Items | % of Value | Policy |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **A** | 20% | 80% | Tight control, frequent review, precise EOQ |
| **B** | 30% | 15% | Moderate control, periodic review |
| **C** | 50% | 5% | Simple rules, infrequent review, large orders |

**Example Application:**
- **A items:** Calculate EOQ precisely, order weekly
- **B items:** Order monthly using approximate EOQ
- **C items:** Order quarterly, bulk quantities

**2. Periodic vs. Continuous Review:**

**Continuous Review (Q System):**
- Monitor inventory constantly
- Order fixed quantity (Q) when inventory reaches reorder point
- Suitable for expensive items (A items)

**Periodic Review (P System):**
- Check inventory at fixed intervals
- Order variable quantity to reach target level
- Suitable for low-value items (C items)
- Can consolidate orders

**3. Lot-for-Lot:**

Order exactly what's needed, when needed:

```
NO cycle inventory held
Works when ordering costs are low
Common in JIT systems
```

**Example:** Daily deliveries of components to assembly plant

**4. Technology Enablers:**

**Automated Reordering:**
- Systems automatically generate orders at reorder points
- Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with suppliers
- Reduces ordering costs (lower S justifies smaller Q)

**Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI):**
- Supplier monitors inventory and replenishes
- Transfers inventory management responsibility
- Better coordination, reduced costs

### 7.3.6 Cycle Inventory Reduction Strategies

**Approaches to Lower Cycle Inventory:**

**1. Reduce Ordering Costs:**

```
If S decreases → EOQ decreases → Lower cycle inventory

Example:
Current: S = $100, EOQ = 500 units
If reduce S to $25 (EDI, process improvement):
New EOQ = √(25/100) × 500 = 0.5 × 500 = 250 units

Cycle inventory reduced from 250 to 125 units (50% reduction)
```

**2. Aggregate Demand:**

Consolidate multiple locations:

```
BEFORE (3 separate locations):
Each location: D = 1,000, S = $50, H = $5
EOQ per location = √(2×1,000×50/5) = 141 units
Total cycle inventory = 3 × 71 = 213 units

AFTER (centralized):
Total D = 3,000, S = $50, H = $5
EOQ = √(2×3,000×50/5) = 245 units
Total cycle inventory = 123 units

Reduction: 42% lower inventory through centralization
```

**3. Third-Party Logistics:**

Outsource to specialists who aggregate multiple clients:

- Shared transportation
- Cross-docking
- Milk runs
- Lower effective S for clients

## 7.4 Safety Inventory

### 7.4.1 Definition and Purpose

**Safety inventory** (also called safety stock or buffer stock) is inventory held to protect against uncertainty in demand, supply, or lead time.

**Key Distinction:**

```
CYCLE INVENTORY: Meets expected (average) demand
SAFETY INVENTORY: Protects against variability (unexpected demand)

Total Inventory = Cycle Inventory + Safety Inventory
```

**Why Safety Inventory is Necessary:**

1. **Demand Uncertainty:** Actual demand may exceed forecast
2. **Supply Uncertainty:** Deliveries may be delayed
3. **Lead Time Variability:** Replenishment time fluctuates
4. **Quality Issues:** Some received units may be defective

**Graphical Representation:**

```

    |0 ────│─────────────────────────────→ Time
          └─ Cycle ─┘└─ Cycle ─┘

Safety Stock provides buffer above zero
```

### 7.4.2 Service Level and Product Availability

**Service Level** defines the desired probability of not stocking out during a replenishment cycle.

#### **Key Metrics:**

**1. Cycle Service Level (CSL):**

```
CSL = Probability of not stocking out in a replenishment cycle
    = 1 - Probability of stockout
```

**Example:** 95% cycle service level means 95% of replenishment cycles have no stockouts.

**2. Fill Rate (FR):**

```
Fill Rate = Fraction of demand satisfied from inventory
```

**Example:** 98% fill rate means 98% of units requested are immediately available.

**Relationship:** Higher service level → More safety stock needed

**3. Stock out Probability:**

```
Stockout Probability = 1 - Cycle Service Level
```

**Example:** 95% CSL → 5% stockout probability

#### **Factors Influencing Desired Service Level:**

| Factor | Impact on Service Level |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Product criticality** | Critical items → Higher service level |
| **Customer expectations** | Premium customers → Higher level |
| **Product value** | Low-value → Can afford higher level |
| **Competition** | Intense competition → Higher level |
| **Cost of stockout** | High cost → Higher level |
| **Holding cost** | High cost → Lower level acceptable |

**Typical Service Levels by Industry:**

| Industry/Product | Typical CSL |
|------------------|-------------|
| Healthcare (critical drugs) | 99-99.9% |
| Spare parts (machinery) | 95-98% |
| Fashion retail | 90-95% |
| Grocery staples | 95-98% |
| Seasonal items | 85-90% |

### 7.4.3 Calculating Safety Inventory

Safety inventory depends on:
1. Demand variability
2. Lead time
3. Desired service level

#### **Basic Safety Stock Formula:**

```
Safety Stock (ss) = z × σ_L

Where:
z = safety factor (from service level)
σ_L = standard deviation of demand during lead time
```

#### **Safety Factor (z) from Service Level:**

The z-value corresponds to the desired service level from the standard normal distribution:

| Cycle Service Level | z-value |
|---------------------|---------|
| 50% | 0.00 |
| 80% | 0.84 |
| 85% | 1.04 |
| 90% | 1.28 |
| 95% | 1.65 |
| 97.5% | 1.96 |
| 99% | 2.33 |
| 99.5% | 2.58 |
| 99.9% | 3.09 |

**Interpretation:** For 95% service level, safety stock covers demand up to 1.65 standard deviations above the mean.

#### **Demand Standard Deviation During Lead Time (σ_L):**

**Case 1: Known demand standard deviation per period (σ_D) and constant lead time (L):**

```
σ_L = σ_D × √L

Where:
σ_D = standard deviation of demand per period
L = lead time in periods
```

**Example:**
- Weekly demand standard deviation (σ_D) = 50 units
- Lead time (L) = 4 weeks

```
σ_L = 50 × √4 = 50 × 2 = 100 units
```

**Case 2: Known demand mean (μ_D), standard deviation (σ_D), lead time mean (μ_L), and lead time standard deviation (σ_L):**

```
σ_L = √(L × σ_D² + μ_D² × σ_L²)
```

This accounts for both demand and lead time variability.

#### **Complete Safety Stock Example:**

**Given:**
- Average weekly demand = 200 units
- Standard deviation of weekly demand = 50 units
- Lead time = 3 weeks (constant)
- Desired cycle service level = 95%

**Step 1: Find z-value**
```
For 95% CSL, z = 1.65
```

**Step 2: Calculate σ_L**
```
σ_L = σ_D × √L
σ_L = 50 × √3
σ_L = 50 × 1.732
σ_L = 86.6 units
```

**Step 3: Calculate safety stock**
```
ss = z × σ_L
ss = 1.65 × 86.6
ss = 143 units
```

**Step 4: Calculate reorder point**
```
Reorder Point (ROP) = Average demand during lead time + Safety stock
ROP = (Average weekly demand × Lead time) + ss
ROP = (200 × 3) + 143
ROP = 600 + 143
ROP = 743 units
```

**Interpretation:** When inventory reaches 743 units, place an order. The 143 units of safety stock protect against demand exceeding 600 units during the 3-week lead time.

### 7.4.4 Impact of Service Level on Safety Inventory

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

Using same example (weekly demand mean = 200, σ = 50, L = 3 weeks):

| Service Level | z-value | Safety Stock | % Increase |
|---------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 50% | 0.00 | 0 | Base |
| 85% | 1.04 | 90 | - |
| 90% | 1.28 | 111 | 23% |
| 95% | 1.65 | 143 | 29% |
| 99% | 2.33 | 202 | 41% |
| 99.9% | 3.09 | 268 | 33% |

**Key Insight:** Moving from 95% to 99% service level (4 percentage point increase) requires 41% more safety stock.

**Diminishing Returns:**

```

    |_________________________→
    50%  70%  85%  95%  99%  SERVICE LEVEL
    
Each incremental service level improvement
costs progressively more safety stock
```

### 7.4.5 Trade-offs in Setting Safety Inventory

#### **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

**Benefits of Higher Safety Stock:**
1. Fewer stockouts
2. Higher customer satisfaction
3. Reduced lost sales
4. Better reputation
5. Avoided expediting costs

**Costs of Higher Safety Stock:**
1. Increased holding costs
2. More capital tied up
3. Higher obsolescence risk
4. Greater storage requirements
5. Potential waste/spoilage

#### **Optimal Service Level Framework:**

**Marginal Analysis Approach:**

Increase safety stock until:

```
Marginal Cost of adding one more unit = Marginal Benefit of that unit
```

**Simplified Formula:**

```
Optimal CSL when:
Cost of holding safety stock × (1 - CSL) = Cost of stockout × CSL
```

**Example Calculation:**

**Given:**
- Annual holding cost per unit (H) = $5
- Cost per stockout (lost profit + intangibles) = $50
- Current demand and variability suggest need for safety stock decision

**Find optimal service level:**

```
At equilibrium:
H × (1 - CSL) = Stockout cost × Stockout probability
H × (1 - CSL) = $50 × (1 - CSL)
```

Rearranging:
```
CSL = Stockout cost / (Stockout cost + H)
CSL = $50 / ($50 + $5)
CSL = $50 / $55
CSL = 0.909 or 90.9%
```

**Interpretation:** Optimal service level is approximately 91%.

#### **Product Classification and Service Levels:**

Different products warrant different service levels:

**Matrix Approach:**

| Product Type | Characteristics | Typical Service Level |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **A-Critical** | High value, critical to operations | 98-99% |
| **A-Standard** | High value, standard | 95-97% |
| **B-Critical** | Medium value, critical | 95-97% |
| **B-Standard** | Medium value, standard | 90-95% |
| **C-All** | Low value | 85-90% |

### 7.4.6 Strategies for Managing Safety Inventory

#### **1. Reduce Demand Uncertainty:**

**Improve Forecasting:**
- Better demand forecasting methods
- Collaborative planning with customers
- Point-of-sale data sharing
- Advanced analytics and machine learning

**Impact:**
```
If σ_D reduced by 20%:
Safety stock also reduces by 20%
```

**Example:**
- Original σ_D = 50, safety stock = 143 units (95% CSL, L=3)
- Improved forecasting: σ_D = 40
- New safety stock = 1.65 × 40 × √3 = 114 units
- Reduction: 29 units (20% savings)

#### **2. Reduce Lead Time:**

**Shorter lead times reduce uncertainty:**

```
Safety Stock = z × σ_D × √L

If L decreases → Safety stock decreases
```

**Example:**
- Original: L = 3 weeks, ss = 1.65 × 50 × √3 = 143 units
- Reduced to: L = 1 week
- New ss = 1.65 × 50 × √1 = 83 units
- Reduction: 42% savings

**Strategies to Reduce Lead Time:**
- Local sourcing instead of overseas
- Faster transportation modes
- Supplier partnerships for priority
- Dedicated production capacity

#### **3. Reduce Lead Time Variability:**

**Make lead time more predictable:**

```
When lead time has variability:
σ_L = √(L × σ_D² + μ_D² × σ_time²)

Reducing σ_time (lead time variability) reduces σ_L
```

**Approaches:**
- Reliable suppliers
- Backup suppliers
- Buffer inventory at supplier
- Better logistics partners

#### **4. Pooling Strategies:**

**Virtual Pooling (Information Sharing):**

Share inventory information across locations without physical consolidation:

```
BEFORE: 3 independent locations
Safety stock per location: 100 units
Total: 300 units

AFTER: Shared visibility, transshipments possible
Total safety stock needed: 180 units
Savings: 40%
```

**Physical Pooling (Centralization):**

Consolidate inventory:

```
Safety stock reduces by √n for n locations

Example: 4 locations consolidated to 1
Safety stock reduction = √4 = 2 (50% reduction)
```

**Component Commonality:**

Design products with common components:

- Reduces variety requiring safety stock
- Postponement strategies
- Risk pooling benefits

#### **5. Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI):**

Supplier manages buyer's inventory:

**Benefits:**
- Supplier has better demand visibility
- Can aggregate demand across customers
- Reduces bullwhip effect
- Lower safety stock needed overall

**Example:**
- Walmart's VMI with Procter & Gamble
- P&G monitors inventory, automatically replenishes
- Reduced safety stock by 20-30% for both parties

#### **6. Quick Response Systems:**

Respond rapidly to actual demand:

**Fashion Retail Example:**
- Traditional: Produce full season quantity before season
- Quick Response: Produce 50% initially, read demand, produce balance

**Impact:**
- Lower safety stock needed
- Reduced obsolescence
- Better matching to actual demand

### 7.4.7 Continuous vs. Periodic Review Systems

#### **Continuous Review (Q-System):**

**Mechanism:**
- Monitor inventory continuously
- Order quantity Q when inventory ≤ Reorder Point (ROP)

**Reorder Point:**
```
ROP = Average demand during lead time + Safety stock
ROP = μ_L + ss
ROP = μ_D × L + z × σ_D × √L
```

**Safety Stock for Q-System:**
```
ss = z × σ_L
```

**Advantages:**
- Lower safety stock required
- Immediate response to inventory changes
- Suitable for expensive items (A items)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires constant monitoring
- Higher administrative costs
- Needs technology support

#### **Periodic Review (P-System):**

**Mechanism:**
- Check inventory at fixed intervals (e.g., weekly)
- Order variable quantity to reach target level (Order-Up-To Level, OUL)

**Order-Up-To Level:**
```
OUL = Average demand during (review period + lead time) + Safety stock
OUL = μ_D × (P + L) + ss
```

**Safety Stock for P-System:**
```
ss = z × σ_D × √(P + L)

Where P = review period
```

**Key Difference:** Safety stock must cover review period + lead time (longer uncertainty window)

**Comparison Example:**

**Given:**
- Weekly demand: μ_D = 200, σ_D = 50
- Lead time (L) = 2 weeks
- Service level = 95% (z = 1.65)
- Review period (P) = 1 week (for periodic system)

**Q-System (Continuous):**
```
ss = 1.65 × 50 × √2 = 117 units
ROP = 200 × 2 + 117 = 517 units
```

**P-System (Periodic):**
```
ss = 1.65 × 50 × √(1 + 2) = 1.65 × 50 × √3 = 143 units
OUL = 200 × (1 + 2) + 143 = 743 units
```

**Comparison:**
- Periodic system requires 22% more safety stock (143 vs. 117)
- Trade-off: Lower administrative cost vs. higher inventory cost

### 7.4.8 Real-World Considerations

#### **Practical Challenges:**

## 7.5 Integrated Inventory Management

### 7.5.1 Combined Cycle and Safety Inventory

**Total Inventory in a Continuous Review System:**

```
Total Inventory = Cycle Inventory + Safety Inventory
                = Q/2 + ss
                = Q/2 + z × σ_D × √L
```

**Example Integration:**

**Given:**
- Annual demand (D) = 10,000 units
- Ordering cost (S) = $100/order
- Holding cost (H) = $10/unit/year
- Weekly demand: μ = 200, σ = 50
- Lead time (L) = 2 weeks
- Desired CSL = 95% (z = 1.65)

**Step 1: Calculate EOQ (cycle inventory)**
```
Q* = √(2 × 10,000 × 100 / 10) = √200,000 = 447 units
Average cycle inventory = 447/2 = 224 units
```

**Step 2: Calculate safety stock**
```
ss = 1.65 × 50 × √2 = 117 units
```

**Step 3: Total average inventory**
```
Average Total Inventory = 224 + 117 = 341 units
```

**Step 4: Reorder point**
```
ROP = (200 units/week × 2 weeks) + 117 = 517 units
```

**Step 5: Total annual costs**
```
Ordering cost = (10,000/447) × $100 = $2,237
Cycle holding cost = (447/2) × $10 = $2,235
Safety stock holding cost = 117 × $10 = $1,170
Total cost = $2,237 + $2,235 + $1,170 = $5,642
```

### 7.5.2 Multi-Echelon Inventory Systems

In supply chains with multiple stages, inventory decisions interact:

```
SUPPLIER → MANUFACTURER → DISTRIBUTOR → RETAILER
    ↓           ↓              ↓            ↓
   Raw        WIP          Finished      Display
Materials   Inventory      Goods         Inventory
```

**Key Principle:** Centralized control can reduce total system inventory compared to decentralized decision-making.

**Example:**

**Decentralized (each stage independent):**
- Each stage holds safety stock for 95% service level
- Cumulative safety stock across chain: High

**Centralized (coordinated):**
- System-wide optimization
- Strategic positioning of safety stock
- Total safety stock: 30-50% lower

**Where to Hold Safety Stock:**

| Stage | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| **Upstream (supplier/manufacturer)** | Long lead times, economies of scale |
| **Midstream (distributor)** | Balance between cost and responsiveness |
| **Downstream (retailer)** | Close to customer, fast response |

**Strategic Decision:** Depends on lead times, demand variability, product value, and service requirements.

### 7.5.3 Bangladesh Context: Inventory Management Practices

#### **FMCG Sector:**

**Typical Inventory Levels:**

| Company Tier | Inventory Turns | Days of Inventory |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Multinational (Unilever)** | 12-15 turns | 24-30 days |
| **Large local (Square, Pran)** | 8-12 turns | 30-45 days |
| **Medium companies** | 6-8 turns | 45-60 days |
| **Small manufacturers** | 4-6 turns | 60-90 days |

**Challenges:**

1. **Infrastructure Limitations:**
   - Limited warehouse space (high costs in cities)
   - Traffic congestion delays deliveries
   - Uncertain lead times require higher safety stock

**Example:** Dhaka traffic unpredictability adds 1-2 days variability to lead time, increasing safety stock by 20-30%.

2. **Distributor Credit:**
   - Distributors hold 15-30 days inventory
   - Retailers hold 7-15 days
   - Total pipeline inventory: 30-45 days
   - Much higher than developed markets (15-20 days)

3. **Demand Variability:**
   - Seasonal peaks (Ramadan, Eid)
   - Promotional volatility
   - Regional variations

**Response:** Build seasonal inventory 2-3 months before peak, increasing holding costs.

4. **Limited Technology:**
   - Many companies lack sophisticated inventory systems
   - Manual ordering processes
   - Poor demand visibility

#### **Agricultural Products:**

**Characteristics:**
- High perishability → Minimal cycle inventory
- Extreme demand uncertainty → Difficult safety stock planning
- Seasonal supply → Build inventory during harvest

**Rice Example:**

```
HARVEST SEASON (Boro: April-May):
- Farmers sell immediately (need cash, no storage)
- Millers and traders BUY HEAVILY and STORE
- Prices lowest

OFF-SEASON (August-March):
- Stored rice released gradually
- Prices increase 15-25%
- Inventory = Speculative + Safety stock
```

**Government Role:**
- Public Food Distribution System holds strategic reserves
- Target: 1-1.5 million MT rice stock
- Safety stock for food security
- Released during price spikes

**Fresh Vegetables:**

```
Cycle inventory: Near zero (sell within 24-48 hours)
Safety inventory: Impossible (perishability)
Strategy: 
  - Frequent small orders
  - Multiple sourcing points
  - Accept some stockouts on specific items
```

#### **Pharmaceutical Sector:**

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Critical products → High service levels (98-99%)
- Regulatory requirements → Traceability needed
- High product value → JIT preferred where possible
- Temperature sensitivity → Cold chain costs

**Leading Practice (Square Pharma):**

```
Manufacturing:
- EPQ-based production batches
- Safety stock of raw materials (APIs): 60-90 days (import lead time)

Distribution:
- Regional depots: 15-20 days cycle inventory
- Safety stock: 7-10 days (98% service level)
- Distributor: 10-15 days
- Retail pharmacy: 30-40 days (higher safety stock due to unpredictable demand)
```

**Challenge:** Managing near-expiry products
- Short shelf life items (6-12 months)
- FEFO (First Expiry, First Out)
- Returns of near-expiry stock
- Trade-offs between service level and waste

---

## 7.6 Chapter Summary

This chapter explored the critical role of inventory in supply chain management, focusing on three key concepts:

### Key Takeaways:

**1. Economies of Scale:**
- Larger order quantities reduce per-unit costs (ordering, production, transportation)
- Trade-off: Cost savings vs. increased holding costs and reduced flexibility
- Optimal balance achieved through models like EOQ
- Strategies: Order consolidation, temporal aggregation, third-party logistics

**2. Cycle Inventory:**
- Inventory held to meet expected demand between replenishments
- Average cycle inventory = Q/2
- EOQ model determines optimal order quantity: Q* = √(2DS/H)
- At EOQ, annual ordering cost = annual holding cost
- Extensions: Quantity discounts, EPQ, joint replenishment
- Management: ABC analysis, periodic vs. continuous review, technology enablers
- Reduction strategies: Lower ordering costs, aggregate demand, VMI

**3. Safety Inventory:**
- Buffer stock to protect against demand and supply uncertainty
- Determined by: Desired service level (z-value) × Demand variability during lead time (σ_L)
- Safety stock = z × σ_D × √L
- Higher service levels require exponentially more safety stock (diminishing returns)
- Trade-off: Stockout costs vs. holding costs
- Management strategies: Improve forecasting, reduce lead time, pooling, quick response
- Continuous review requires less safety stock than periodic review

**4. Integrated Inventory Management:**
- Total inventory = Cycle inventory + Safety inventory
- Reorder point (ROP) = Average demand during lead time + Safety stock
- Multi-echelon optimization can significantly reduce system-wide inventory
- Real-world complexities: Demand patterns, lead time variability, technology constraints

**5. Bangladesh Context:**
- FMCG: Higher inventory levels than global benchmarks due to infrastructure and credit practices
- Agriculture: Seasonal inventory building, minimal safety stock for perishables
- Pharmaceuticals: High service levels, complex expiry management
- Common challenges: Infrastructure limitations, demand variability, technology gaps
- Improving: Digital systems, better forecasting, infrastructure development

### Looking Ahead:

Understanding inventory management provides the foundation for broader supply chain planning and coordination topics. Future chapters will explore how inventory decisions interact with transportation, sourcing, and information systems to create integrated supply chain strategies.

## Review Questions

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. Explain why companies hold inventory despite the associated costs. Provide three distinct reasons with examples.

2. Describe the relationship between economies of scale and inventory. Why do larger order quantities reduce per-unit costs?

3. What is the difference between cycle inventory and safety inventory? How does each serve a different purpose in the supply chain?

4. Explain why the EOQ formula results in ordering cost equaling holding cost at the optimal point.

5. How does service level relate to safety inventory? Why does increasing service level from 95% to 99% require disproportionately more safety stock?

**Application Questions:**

6. Calculate the EOQ for a product with the following characteristics:
   - Annual demand: 5,000 units
   - Ordering cost: $75/order
   - Holding cost: $3/unit/year
   
   Also determine: number of orders per year, time between orders, and total annual cost.

7. A retailer faces the following weekly demand statistics: mean = 150 units, standard deviation = 40 units. Lead time is 3 weeks. Calculate the safety stock needed for 90%, 95%, and 98% service levels. Discuss the trade-offs.

8. Compare two scenarios:
   - **Scenario A:** Order 500 units monthly at $12/unit
   - **Scenario B:** Order 6,000 units annually at $11/unit (10% volume discount)
   
   Given holding cost of 25% of unit value, which is better? Show calculations.

9. A company has four retail locations, each with weekly demand mean = 100, standard deviation = 30. Lead time = 2 weeks. Calculate total safety stock needed for 95% service level:
   - (a) If each location manages inventory independently
   - (b) If inventory is centralized
   
   What is the percentage reduction?

**Critical Thinking Questions:**

10. "High inventory levels indicate poor supply chain management." Discuss this statement. Under what circumstances might high inventory be appropriate?

11. Analyze why fast-fashion retailers like Zara maintain lower inventory levels than traditional retailers despite potentially missing sales. What supply chain capabilities enable this strategy?

12. In Bangladesh's FMCG sector, inventory turnover is lower than in developed markets. Identify three specific causes and propose solutions for each.

13. For perishable agricultural products in Bangladesh (like fish or vegetables), traditional safety stock approaches don't work. Design an alternative inventory strategy that addresses perishability while maintaining product availability.

## Case Study: Square Toiletries' Inventory Optimization

**Background:**

Square Toiletries Limited (STL), a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, manufactures personal care products including soaps, shampoos, and detergents. With 250,000+ retail outlets and a distribution network of 150 distributors, inventory management is critical to profitability.

**Current Situation (2023):**

**Distribution Network:**
- 8 regional depots
- Average depot inventory: 25 days
- Distributor inventory: 20 days
- Retailer inventory: 15 days
- Total pipeline: 60 days

**Product Portfolio:**
- 50+ SKUs
- Mix of high-turnover (soap) and slow-moving (premium shampoos)
- Shelf life: 24-36 months

**Challenges Identified:**

1. **High Inventory Costs:**
   - Inventory carrying cost: 28% of value annually
   - Working capital tied up: BDT 500 crore
   - Storage constraints in urban depots

2. **Stockouts:**
   - Popular SKUs stock out 8% of the time at retail
   - Depot stockouts cause distributor complaints
   - Lost sales estimated at BDT 25 crore annually

3. **Excess Inventory:**
   - Slow-moving SKUs: 12 months+ inventory
   - Near-expiry returns from distributors: 2% of sales
   - Obsolescence cost: BDT 5 crore annually

4. **Operational Issues:**
   - Manual ordering at most distributors
   - Poor demand visibility from retail level
   - Dhaka traffic causes lead time variability (±2 days)

**Management Questions:**

The CEO has tasked the supply chain team with reducing total inventory by 20% while improving service levels to 96% (from current 92%).

**Analysis Required:**

1. **Current Inventory Analysis:**
   - Calculate current inventory turnover
   - Identify components: cycle vs. safety inventory
   - Estimate holding costs by category

2. **EOQ Application:**
   - Select 3 representative products (high/medium/low volume)
   - Calculate current vs. optimal order quantities for distributors
   - Estimate potential savings

3. **Safety Stock Optimization:**
   - Given lead time variability, calculate appropriate safety stock levels
   - Determine service level targets by product category (A/B/C classification)
   - Quantify inventory reduction opportunity

4. **Strategic Recommendations:**
   - Should STL invest BDT 10 crore in distributor management system (DMS) that reduces ordering costs by 60% and improves demand visibility?
   - Should depot numbers be increased (more responsive but higher total inventory) or decreased (economies of scale)?
   - How can STL reduce lead time variability?
   - What technology investments are justified?

5. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Prioritize initiatives by impact and feasibility
   - Develop 18-month roadmap
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

**Data Provided:**

**Representative Products:**

| Product | Annual Demand | Current Order Qty | Ordering Cost | Unit Cost | Weekly Demand SD |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Popular Soap | 10,000,000 bars | 50,000 | $200 | $0.50 | 5,000 |
| Standard Shampoo | 2,000,000 bottles | 20,000 | $200 | $1.20 | 1,200 |
| Premium Conditioner | 200,000 bottles | 5,000 | $200 | $3.00 | 300 |

- Holding cost: 28% of unit value
- Current lead time: Mean = 5 days, SD = 2 days
- Current service level: 92% (z = 1.41)
- Target service level: 96% (z = 1.75)

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Calculate the EOQ for each product. How do current order quantities compare? What's the potential annual savings?

2. Calculate current and optimal safety stock levels for the popular soap product. What's the inventory reduction opportunity?

3. Perform a cost-benefit analysis of the DMS investment. Consider both cycle inventory and safety inventory impacts. What's the payback period?

4. STL is considering a quick response initiative: reduce lead time to 3 days (SD = 1 day) by using dedicated express logistics. Express shipping costs 25% more than standard. For the popular soap product, is this economically justified?

5. Design an integrated inventory strategy for STL that addresses all identified challenges. Prioritize initiatives and estimate total inventory reduction and cost savings.

## Practical Exercise: Inventory Optimization for a Bangladesh Retailer

**Scenario:**

You are the operations manager for "Shohoj Mart," a growing modern retail chain in Bangladesh with 15 stores in Dhaka and Chattogram. You sell groceries and FMCG products.

**Current Situation:**

- 2,500 active SKUs
- Current average inventory: 35 days (industry benchmark: 25 days)
- Stockout rate: 12% (target: 5%)
- Inventory holding cost: 25% annually
- Total inventory value: BDT 8 crore

**Sample Product Data:**

**Product: Popular rice brand (5kg bags)**
- Weekly demand per store: Mean = 50 bags, SD = 15 bags
- Supplier lead time: 1 week (very reliable)
- Ordering cost: BDT 500 per order per store
- Unit cost: BDT 250/bag
- Retail price: BDT 300/bag
- Current ordering: Each store orders independently, 100 bags every 2 weeks

**Tasks:**

**1. Current State Analysis:**
- Calculate current cycle inventory
- Calculate current safety stock (assuming 90% service level)
- Calculate total annual costs (ordering + holding) for current system
- Calculate inventory turnover

**2. EOQ Optimization:**
- Calculate optimal order quantity using EOQ
- Determine optimal ordering frequency
- Calculate cost savings vs. current practice
- What challenges might arise in implementing EOQ?

**3. Safety Stock Decisions:**
- Calculate safety stock for 95% and 98% service levels
- Estimate lost profit from stockouts at current 90% level
- Determine optimal service level considering trade-offs
- Calculate total inventory reduction opportunity

**4. Centralization Analysis:**
- Calculate total safety stock if all 15 stores order independently (95% service level)
- Calculate safety stock if inventory is centralized to one warehouse serving all stores
- What is the percentage reduction in safety stock?
- What are the operational implications and feasibility in Bangladesh context?

**5. Technology Investment:**
- An inventory management system costs BDT 15 lakh (one-time) + BDT 2 lakh annually
- System benefits: 40% reduction in ordering costs, 10% improvement in forecast accuracy (lower σ)
- Calculate annual savings from this investment
- What is the payback period?
- Should Shohoj Mart invest? Justify your answer.
