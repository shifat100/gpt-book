### 8.1.5 Logistics Cost Trade-offs

Logistics decisions involve complex trade-offs:

**The Total Cost Concept:**

```
TOTAL LOGISTICS COST
    ↓
Transportation + Warehousing + Inventory + Order Processing + Lot Quantity

Optimizing one component may increase others
Goal: Minimize TOTAL cost, not individual components
```

**Example Trade-off Analysis:**

**Scenario: Fast vs. Slow Shipping**

| Factor | Slow Shipping (Sea) | Fast Shipping (Air) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Transportation cost** | $5,000 | $25,000 |
| **Transit time** | 30 days | 3 days |
| **Inventory in transit** | $500,000 | $50,000 |
| **Inventory carrying cost (25%)** | $10,274 | $1,027 |
| **Risk of obsolescence** | Higher | Lower |
| **Stockout risk** | Higher | Lower |
| **Total relevant cost** | $15,274 | $26,027 |

**Decision:** Depends on product value, urgency, and obsolescence risk.

**For high-value electronics:** Air freight may be justified
**For bulk commodities:** Sea freight optimal

## 8.2 Movement Within a Facility

### 8.2.1 Internal Logistics Overview

**Definition:** Internal logistics refers to the movement, handling, and storage of materials within a facility (warehouse, distribution center, manufacturing plant).

**Importance:**
- Can represent **30-50% of total warehouse operating costs**
- Directly impacts order fulfillment speed
- Affects warehouse capacity utilization
- Influences worker safety and productivity

**Scope of Internal Movement:**

```
RECEIVING → PUTAWAY → STORAGE → PICKING → PACKING → SHIPPING
    ↓          ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
 Unload    Transport   Store    Retrieve   Prepare   Load
 Inspect     to        goods     items      orders    for
 Count    location              for order            delivery
```

### 8.2.2 Warehouse Functions and Operations

#### **Primary Warehouse Functions:**

**1. Receiving:**

**Activities:**
- Unload trucks/containers
- Inspect for damage
- Verify quantities against purchase orders
- Check quality
- Update inventory systems

**Key Considerations:**
- Dock scheduling to avoid congestion
- Equipment availability (forklifts, pallet jacks)
- Inspection procedures
- Documentation accuracy

**Best Practices:**
- **Advance Ship Notice (ASN):** Supplier sends delivery details electronically before arrival
- **Cross-docking:** Direct transfer from receiving to shipping (minimal storage)
- **Drop and hook:** Trailer dropped at dock, picked up later (driver doesn't wait)

**2. Putaway:**

**Definition:** Moving received goods to their storage locations.

**Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Fixed location** | Each SKU has dedicated location | Slow-moving items, easy training |
| **Random/floating** | Items stored in any available space | High-volume facilities, space optimization |
| **Zone-based** | Products grouped by characteristics | Mixed product types |
| **Class-based** | Fast movers near shipping, slow movers farther | Optimizing picking efficiency |

**Example Calculation:**

```
Warehouse: 10,000 sq ft
Fixed location system: 60% space utilization (many locations partially empty)
Random location system: 85% space utilization

Space saving: 85% - 60% = 25% more capacity
Equivalent to 2,500 sq ft additional space
```

**3. Storage:**

**Storage System Types:**

| System | Density | Selectivity | Cost | Best Application |
|--------|---------|-------------|------|------------------|
| **Block stacking** | High | Low | Low | Palletized, uniform SKUs |
| **Pallet racking** | Medium | High | Medium | Standard pallets, varied SKUs |
| **Drive-in racking** | High | Low | Medium | LIFO products, fewer SKUs |
| **Flow racking** | Medium | High | High | FIFO products, high turnover |
| **Automated storage (AS/RS)** | Very High | Very High | Very High | High volume, high value |

**Storage Principles:**

**ABC Classification for Storage:**

```
A ITEMS (20% of SKUs, 80% of picks)
    ↓
Store near shipping area
    ↓
Minimize travel distance

B ITEMS (30% of SKUs, 15% of picks)
    ↓
Middle zones

C ITEMS (50% of SKUs, 5% of picks)
    ↓
Farther locations acceptable
```

**Cube Utilization:**

```
Cube Utilization = (Volume actually used / Total available volume) × 100%

Goal: >70% cube utilization
Challenge: Balance between utilization and accessibility
```

**4. Order Picking:**

**Definition:** Retrieving items from storage to fulfill customer orders.

**Critical Fact:** Picking is typically **50-60% of warehouse operating costs** and the most labor-intensive activity.

**Picking Methods:**

**A. Discrete Picking (Pick-to-Order):**

```
One picker, one order at a time
    ↓
Picker travels warehouse collecting all items for one order
    ↓
Simple, accurate, but SLOW for high volume
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement and manage
- Clear accountability per order
- Fewer picking errors
- Good for low-volume operations

**Disadvantages:**
- High travel time per order
- Low productivity
- Inefficient use of labor

**B. Batch Picking:**

```
One picker, multiple orders simultaneously
    ↓
Picker collects same item for multiple orders in one trip
    ↓
Then sorts items by order
```

**Example:**
- 10 orders need Item A
- Picker picks 10 units of Item A in one trip
- Then moves to Item B location, picks for 10 orders
- At end, sorts all picked items into individual orders

**Advantages:**
- Reduced travel time
- Higher productivity (2-3x vs. discrete)
- Better for high-volume operations

**Disadvantages:**
- Sorting required (additional step)
- More complex management
- Risk of sorting errors

**C. Zone Picking:**

```
Warehouse divided into zones
    ↓
Each picker assigned to one zone
    ↓
Order moves zone-to-zone (pick-and-pass)
OR items from all zones converge at pack station
```

**Example:**
```
ZONE A           ZONE B           ZONE C
(Electronics)    (Clothing)       (Books)
    ↓               ↓               ↓
Picker 1        Picker 2        Picker 3
    ↓               ↓               ↓
        Order consolidation
            ↓
        Complete order
```

**Advantages:**
- Pickers learn zones well (faster picking)
- Parallel processing (zones work simultaneously)
- Reduced congestion

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex coordination required
- Imbalanced workloads possible
- Investment in conveyors/systems

**D. Wave Picking:**

```
Orders released in "waves" at scheduled times
    ↓
All pickers work on same wave simultaneously
    ↓
Complete wave, start next wave
```

**Example:**
- Wave 1: 8:00 AM - All orders shipping today
- Wave 2: 12:00 PM - All orders for next-day delivery
- Wave 3: 4:00 PM - All replenishment for stores

**Advantages:**
- Predictable workflow
- Enables load planning
- Efficient use of resources

**E. Pick-to-Light:**

```
Light displays on storage locations
    ↓
Light illuminates when picker should pick from that location
    ↓
Display shows quantity to pick
    ↓
Picker confirms completion (button press)
```

**Advantages:**
- Very fast (2-3 seconds per pick)
- Error reduction (40-50% fewer errors)
- No paper, hands-free
- Minimal training required

**Disadvantages:**
- High initial investment ($50-200 per location)
- Best for high-velocity items
- Less flexible for SKU changes

**F. Voice Picking:**

```
Picker wears headset
    ↓
System gives voice instructions ("Go to location A-5-3")
    ↓
Picker confirms verbally ("A-5-3 confirmed")
    ↓
System: "Pick 5 units of item 12345"
    ↓
Picker: "5 picked"
```

**Advantages:**
- Hands-free, eyes-free
- 15-25% productivity improvement
- Improved accuracy (99%+)
- Worker safety (see obstacles)

**Disadvantages:**
- Moderate investment
- Noisy environments challenging
- Accent/language considerations

**Picking Productivity Metrics:**

| Method | Lines per Hour | Productivity Index |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Discrete (paper) | 40-60 | 1.0x (base) |
| Batch | 80-120 | 2.0x |
| Zone | 100-150 | 2.5x |
| Pick-to-light | 200-300 | 4.0x |
| Automated | 300-500+ | 6.0x+ |

**5. Packing:**

| **Automated guided vehicle (AGV)** | Repetitive routes, no driver | Varies | $$$$ |
| **Conveyor systems** | High volume, fixed routes | Continuous | $$$$ |
| **Sortation systems** | Automated sorting | 5000-30000/hr | $$$$$ |

**Decision Example:**

**Scenario:** Distribution center handles 5,000 pallets/day

**Option A: Manual pallet jacks**
- Cost: $500 each × 20 = $10,000
- Labor: 20 workers × $15/hr × 8 hrs = $2,400/day
- Annual labor: $2,400 × 250 days = $600,000

**Option B: Electric pallet jacks**
- Cost: $5,000 each × 10 = $50,000
- Labor: 10 workers × $15/hr × 8 hrs = $1,200/day
- Annual labor: $300,000
- Annual savings: $300,000
- Payback: $50,000 / $300,000 = 2 months

**Decision:** Electric pallet jacks clearly justified

```

**C. T-Shaped Flow:**

```
        RECEIVING
            ↓
    STORAGE | STORAGE
            ↓
      ←──PICKING──→
            ↓
        PACKING
            ↓
        SHIPPING

Advantages:
- Balanced flow
- Multiple shipping lanes
```

**Layout Considerations:**

**Aisle Width:**

| Type | Width | Application |
|------|-------|-------------|

| **Narrow aisle** | 2.4-2.7m | Reach trucks, high density |
| **Wide aisle** | 3.4-3.7m | Counterbalance forklifts, flexibility |

**Trade-off:**
- Narrower aisles = More storage capacity (20-40% gain)
- Wider aisles = Faster movement, more flexibility

**Golden Zone Principle:**

```
RACKING HEIGHT
    ↑
High   │ C Items (slow movers)
       ├─────────────────
Golden │ A Items (fast movers) ← Waist to shoulder height
Zone   │                         Easy reach, fast picking
       ├─────────────────
Low    │ B Items (medium movers)
       └─────────────→ 
```

**Slotting Optimization:**

Assign products to locations based on:

1. **Velocity:** Fast movers near shipping
2. **Cube:** Match product size to location size
3. **Compatibility:** Keep complementary items together
4. **Special requirements:** Temperature, security

**Example Impact:**

```
BEFORE slotting optimization:
Average pick travel distance: 150 meters per order
Daily orders: 1,000
Total daily travel: 150 km

AFTER optimization:
Average pick travel distance: 100 meters per order
Total daily travel: 100 km
Reduction: 33% less travel
Labor savings: ~25% productivity improvement
```

```

### 8.3.3 Transportation Cost Structures

**Cost Components:**

**1. Variable Costs:**
- Fuel (30-40% of trucking costs)
- Driver wages/fees
- Maintenance
- Tolls

**2. Fixed Costs:**
- Vehicle depreciation/lease
- Insurance
- Licensing and permits
- Administrative overhead

**3. Semi-Variable:**
- Tires
- Repairs

**Pricing Methods:**

**A. Per-Mile/Kilometer:**
``` Total Cost = Base Rate + (Distance × per-km rate) + Fuel Surcharge
```

**Example:**
- Base: $50
- Distance: 300 km × $0.80/km = $240
- Fuel surcharge: 15% = $36
- **Total: $326**

**B. Per-Weight:**
```
Cost = Weight × Rate per unit weight
```

**C. Per-Pallet/Unit:**
```
Cost = Number of pallets × Rate per pallet
```

**D. Percentage of Value:**
```
Cost = Shipment value × %
```
Used for high-value goods (insurance component)

**E. Flat Rate:**
```
Fixed price for specific lane, regardless of weight (up to capacity)
```

**Freight Rate Negotiation Factors:**

| Factor | Impact on Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| **Volume commitment** | Higher volume → Lower rate |
| **Backhaul availability** | Return loads → Lower rate |
| **Seasonality** | Peak season → Higher rate |
| **Lane balance** | Imbalanced lanes → Higher rate on light side |
| **Fuel prices** | Rising fuel → Surcharges |
| **Competition** | More carriers → Lower rate |

### 8.3.4 Route Planning and Optimization

**Objectives:**
1. Minimize total distance/time
2. Maximize vehicle utilization
3. Meet delivery time windows
4. Balance driver workloads
5. Minimize total cost

**Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP):**

**Basic Example:**

```
DEPOT has 3 customers to serve:
Customer A: 10 km north, 100 kg
Customer B: 15 km east, 150 kg
Customer C: 8 km south, 120 kg

Vehicle capacity: 500 kg
Question: What route minimizes total distance?

Options:
1. Depot → A → B → C → Depot: 10 + 18 + 20 + 8 = 56 km
2. Depot → B → A → C → Depot: 15 + 18 + 15 + 8 = 56 km
3. Depot → C → A → B → Depot: 8 + 15 + 18 + 15 = 56 km
...and so on

Optimal route depends on actual road network geometry
```

**Real-world Complexity:**

- Multiple vehicles
- Time windows (customer availability)
- Driver hours regulations
- Traffic patterns
- Vehicle capacities
- Pickup and delivery (not just delivery)
- Multi-day routes

**Solution Approaches:**

**1. Manual/Rule-of-Thumb:**

| **Backhaul utilization** | Find return loads | Reduce empty miles (30-40% improvement) |
| **Delivery time windows** | Coordinate with customers | Fewer missed deliveries |
| **Real-time tracking** | GPS monitoring | Exception management, customer updates |

### 8.3.5 Freight Consolidation

**Concept:** Combining multiple small shipments into larger loads to achieve economies of scale.

**Benefits:**

```
BEFORE CONSOLIDATION:
5 LTL shipments to same city
Cost: 5 × $500 = $2,500

AFTER CONSOLIDATION:
1 FTL shipment
Cost: $1,200
Savings: $1,300 (52%)
```

**Consolidation Strategies:**

**1. Temporal Consolidation:**
- Wait to accumulate sufficient volume
- Trade-off: Delivery delay vs. cost savings

**Example:**
- Daily LTL to City X: 500 kg/day, $200/day
- Wait 5 days: 2,500 kg, FTL for $600
- Savings: $1,000 - $600 = $400/week
- Cost: 1-5 day delivery delay

**2. Geographic Consolidation:**
- Combine shipments to nearby destinations
- Deliver from local consolidation point

**3. Cross-Dock Consolidation:**
- Hub-and-spoke network
- Shipments consolidated at hub

```
Origin A ──→       ↗ Destination 1
Origin B ──→  HUB  → Destination 2
Origin C ──→       ↘ Destination 3

Multiple inbound (LTL) consolidated to
Multiple outbound (optimized routes)
```

**4. Multi-Vendor Consolidation:**
- Combine orders from multiple suppliers
- Common in retail distribution

**Example:** Retailer orders from 10 suppliers:
- Without consolidation: 10 separate deliveries
- With consolidation: Suppliers ship to consolidator → 1 delivery to retailer

**5. Milk Runs:**
- Regular route collecting from/delivering to multiple locations

```
DEPOT → Supplier A → Supplier B → Supplier C → DEPOT
           ↓            ↓            ↓
        Pick up      Pick up      Pick up
        (instead of 3 separate trips)

Used in: Automotive (JIT parts collection), retail replenishment
Savings: 40-60% vs. individual pickups
```

### 8.3.6 Third-Party Logistics (3PL)

**Definition:** Outsourcing logistics functions to specialized service providers.

**Services Offered:**

## 8.4 Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP)

### 8.4.1 What is DRP?

**Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP)** is a time-phased inventory replenishment planning method that determines when and how much inventory to order and deploy throughout a distribution network.

**Definition:**

> *"DRP is a systematic approach to coordinate inventory management and transportation activities across multiple distribution facilities to ensure product availability while minimizing total system costs."*

**Relationship to Other Planning Systems:**

```
SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNING HIERARCHY

Strategic: Network Design (Where to locate facilities?)
    ↓
Tactical: Master Planning (What to produce/buy overall?)
    ↓
├── MRP (Material Requirements Planning)
│   Manufacturing focus: What materials needed when?
│   
└── DRP (Distribution Requirements Planning)
    Distribution focus: Where to deploy inventory when?
    ↓
Operational: Execution (Daily orders, shipments)
```

### 8.4.2 DRP Logic and Methodology

**Core Principle:** Work backwards from customer demand through distribution network to determine what needs to ship when.

**Basic DRP Process:**

```
STEP 1: Forecast demand at each location
    ↓
STEP 2: Calculate requirements (demand + safety stock)
    ↓
STEP 3: Determine planned orders (when and how much to order)
    ↓
STEP 4: Aggregate requirements upstream
    ↓
STEP 5: Generate replenishment plan
```

**DRP Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Forecast demand** | Expected sales by period by location |
| **Lead time** | Time from order to receipt |
| **Safety stock** | Buffer inventory target |
| **On-hand inventory** | Current inventory level |
| **Scheduled receipts** | Orders already placed, in transit |
| **Lot size** | Order quantity policy (EOQ, fixed, etc.) |
| **Bill of distribution** | Network structure (who supplies whom) |

### 8.4.3 DRP Calculation Example

**Scenario:**

A retail store receives inventory from a regional distribution center (DC).

**Given Data:**
- Forecasted weekly demand: 100 units
- Lead time from DC: 2 weeks
- Safety stock target: 50 units
- On-hand inventory: 250 units
- Order quantity: 200 units (fixed lot size)
- No scheduled receipts currently

**DRP Table for Retail Store:**

| Week | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gross Requirements** (Forecast) | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| **Scheduled Receipts** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Projected On-Hand** | 150 | 50 | **150** | 50 | **150** | 50 |
| **Net Requirements** | 0 | 0 | **100** | 0 | **100** | 0 |
| **Planned Order Receipt** | 0 | 0 | **200** | 0 | **200** | 0 |
| **Planned Order Release** | **200** | 0 | **200** | 0 | 200 | 0 |

**Calculation Logic:**

**Week 1:**
- Starting inventory: 250
- Gross requirements: 100
- Projected on-hand: 250 - 100 = 150 ✓ (above safety stock of 50)
- No order needed

**Week 2:**
- Starting inventory: 150
- Gross requirements: 100
- Projected on-hand: 150 - 100 = 50 (= safety stock)
- **Trigger:** Inventory will hit safety stock
- Net requirement for Week 3+2 (lead time) = 100
- Plan order receipt Week 3: 200 units (lot size)
- **Planned order release Week 1: 200 units** (2 weeks before receipt)

**Week 3:**
- Starting inventory: 50
- Scheduled receipt (from Week 1 order): 200
- Gross requirements: 100
- Projected on-hand: 50 + 200 - 100 = 150

**Pattern repeats...**

**Key Insights:**

1. Orders placed in Week 1 and Week 3
2. Maintains inventory above safety stock
3. Lead time means ordering 2 weeks in advance
4. Fixed lot size of 200 creates sawtooth inventory pattern

### 8.4.4 Multi-Echelon DRP

DRP's real power emerges in multi-level distribution networks.

**Network Example:**

```
CENTRAL DC
    ↓
    ├─→ Regional DC East
    │       ├─→ Store E1
    │       ├─→ Store E2
    │       └─→ Store E3
    │
    └─→ Regional DC West
            ├─→ Store W1
            ├─→ Store W2
            └─→ Store W3
```

**Process:**

**1. Calculate DRP for Each Store:**
- Generate planned orders for each retail location
- These become gross requirements for regional DCs

**2. Aggregate at Regional DC:**
- Sum planned orders from all stores in region
- These are gross requirements for the regional DC
- Calculate regional DC's DRP
- Generate planned orders to Central DC

**3. Aggregate at Central DC:**
- Sum planned orders from all regional DCs
- Calculate Central DC's DRP
- These requirements feed into production planning (MRP)

**Example Aggregation:**

**Regional DC East receives planned orders from stores:**

| Week | Store E1 | Store E2 | Store E3 | **Total Regional Requirement** |
|------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | 200 | 0 | 150 | 350 |
| 2 | 0 | 200 | 0 | 200 |
| 3 | 200 | 0 | 150 | 350 |

**These totals (350, 200, 350) become gross requirements for Regional DC's DRP table.**

**Benefits of Multi-Echelon DRP:**

1. **Coordinated Replenishment:**
   - Upstream facilities know downstream needs in advance
   - Can plan production/procurement accordingly

2. **Reduced Total Inventory:**
   - System-wide optimization
   - Avoids duplicate safety stock at each level

3. **Improved Service:**
   - Anticipates needs before stockouts occur
   - Prioritizes allocation during shortages

4. **Better Transportation Planning:**
   - Know shipment requirements in advance
   - Consolidate shipments
   - Schedule trucks efficiently

### 8.4.5 DRP vs. Reorder Point Systems

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Reorder Point (ROP) | DRP |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| **Logic** | When inventory ≤ ROP, order Q | Time-phased requirements based on forecast |
| **Planning horizon** | None (reactive) | Multiple periods (proactive) |
| **Demand assumption** | Constant | Variable (follows forecast) |
| **Multi-echelon** | Independent per location | Coordinated across network |
| **Lead time demand** | Average + safety stock | Actual forecast for lead time periods |
| **Best for** | Stable demand, single location | Variable demand, multiple locations |

**Example Difference:**

**Scenario:** Seasonal product with demand pattern: 50, 50, 200, 200, 100, 100 units per week

**ROP System:**
- Calculates average demand: (50+50+200+200+100+100)/6 = 117 units/week
- Sets ROP based on average
- **Problem:** Stockout during high-demand weeks (200, 200)

**DRP System:**
- Uses actual forecast: 200 units in Weeks 3-4
- Plans order to arrive before Week 3
- **Result:** No stockout, inventory positioned anticipating demand spike

### 8.4.6 Implementing DRP

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Accurate Demand Forecasts:**
   - DRP quality depends on forecast quality
   - "Garbage in, garbage out"

2. **Data Accuracy:**
   - Real-time inventory data (95%+ accuracy)
   - Correct lead times
   - Current bill of distribution

3. **System Infrastructure:**
   - Software to perform calculations
   - Integration with ERP/WMS
   - Communication across locations

4. **Organizational Alignment:**

## 8.5 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

### 8.5.1 What is EDI?

**Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** is the computer-to-computer exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between trading partners.

**Simple Definition:**

> *"EDI replaces paper documents (purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices) with standardized electronic messages that computers can read and process automatically."*

**Traditional vs. EDI:**

```
TRADITIONAL PROCESS:
Buyer creates PO (paper/PDF) → Email/fax to supplier →
Supplier manually enters into system → Confirms order (paper) →
Ships goods → Creates invoice (paper) → Mails invoice →
Buyer receives, manually enters → Processes payment

Time: Days to weeks
Errors: High (manual data entry)
Cost: High (labor, paper, postage)

EDI PROCESS:
Buyer's system generates EDI PO → Automatically sent to supplier's system →
Supplier's system auto-processes → Confirms via EDI →
Ships goods → System generates EDI invoice → Auto-sent to buyer →
Buyer's system auto-receives → Auto-processes payment

Time: Minutes to hours
Errors: Minimal (no re-keying)
Cost: Low (automated)
```

### 8.5.2 How EDI Works

**Components:**

**1. EDI Standards:**

Define document formats so different systems can understand each other.

**Major Standards:**

| Standard | Region | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **ANSI X12** | North America | Dominant in US |
| **EDIFACT** | International | UN standard, global |
| **TRADACOMS** | UK | Retail sector |
| **VDA** | Germany | Automotive industry |

**Example Document Types (X12):**

| EDI Document | X12 Code | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Purchase Order | 850 | Buyer orders goods |
| Purchase Order Acknowledgment | 855 | Seller confirms order |
| Advance Ship Notice (ASN) | 856 | Notification shipment is coming |
| Invoice | 810 | Payment request |
| Payment Order/Remittance | 820 | Payment notification |
| Inventory Inquiry | 846 | Check stock levels |
| Shipping Instructions | 858 | Shipping details |

**2. EDI Translation Software:**

Converts company's internal data format to/from EDI standard format.

```
COMPANY DATABASE → EDI TRANSLATOR → EDI STANDARD FORMAT
                                            ↓
                                    Sent to partner
                                            ↓
PARTNER DATABASE ← EDI TRANSLATOR ← EDI STANDARD FORMAT
```

**3. Communication Method:**

**Traditional EDI:**
- **Value-Added Network (VAN):** Third-party network that routes EDI messages
- Think of it as "email for EDI documents"
- Secure, reliable, but expensive

**Modern Methods:**
- **AS2 (Applicability Statement 2):** Direct internet transmission
- **FTP/SFTP:** File transfer
- **Web EDI:** Browser-based EDI for smaller partners
- **API:** Real-time integration

### 8.5.3 EDI Transaction Example

**Scenario:** Retailer ordering from supplier

**Step-by-Step:**

**1. Purchase Order (EDI 850):**

**Retailer's system automatically generates when inventory hits reorder point:**

```
EDI 850 Message Structure (simplified):

ST*850*0001~ (Start of PO transaction)
BEG*00*NE*PO-123456*20240115~ (PO number, date)
REF*DP*DEPT-001~ (Department reference)
DTM*002*20240120~ (Requested delivery date)
N1*ST*Retailer Store 5~ (Ship-to location)
N3*123 Main Street~ (Address)
N4*Dhaka**1000*BD~ (City, postal, country)
PO1*1*100*EA*50.00*PE*SKU-A001~ (Line 1: 100 units, $50 each)
PO1*2*200*EA*25.00*PE*SKU-B002~ (Line 2: 200 units, $25 each)
CTT*2~ (Total of 2 line items)
SE*12*0001~ (End of transaction)
```

**2. Purchase Order Acknowledgment (EDI 855):**

**Supplier's system auto-receives, validates, and responds:**

```
EDI 855 Message:

Acknowledges receipt of PO-123456
Confirms: Line 1 - 100 units available, ship date 20240118
Confirms: Line 2 - 200 units available, ship date 20240118
```

**3. Advance Ship Notice (EDI 856):**

**When supplier ships, system auto-sends ASN:**

```
EDI 856 Message:

Shipment notification for PO-123456
Carrier: XYZ Logistics
Tracking number: TRACK-789
Expected delivery: 20240120
Contents:
  - Carton 1: 50 units SKU-A001
  - Carton 2: 50 units SKU-A001
  - Carton 3: 100 units SKU-B002
  - Carton 4: 100 units SKU-B002
```

**4. Receipt and Invoice (EDI 810):**

**Retailer receives shipment, system updates inventory automatically based on ASN**

**Supplier's system generates invoice:**

```
EDI 810 Message:

Invoice for PO-123456
Line 1: 100 units × $50 = $5,000
Line 2: 200 units × $25 = $5,000
Subtotal: $10,000
Shipping: $200
Total: $10,200
Payment terms: Net 30 days
```

**5. Payment (EDI 820):**

**Retailer's system auto-pays per terms, sends remittance:**

```
EDI 820 Message:

Payment for Invoice INV-123456
Amount: $10,200
Method: Electronic funds transfer
Reference: PO-123456
```

**Total Time:** Minutes to hours (vs. days/weeks with paper)

**Human Involvement:** Minimal (only exceptions)

### 8.5.4 Benefits of EDI

**1. Speed:**

| Process | Paper/Email | EDI | Improvement |
|---------|------------|-----|-------------|
| Order placement to receipt | 1-3 days | Minutes | 100-1000x faster |
| Order confirmation | 1-2 days | Minutes | 100-500x |
| Invoice delivery | 2-5 days | Instant | Instant |
| Payment processing | 7-15 days | 1-3 days | 5-10x |

**2. Accuracy:**

- **Paper/Manual:** 2-5% error rate (data entry mistakes)
- **EDI:** <0.1% error rate
- **Impact:** Fewer order corrections, returns, disputes

**Example:**
- Company processing 10,000 orders/month
- Manual error rate: 3% = 300 errors
- Cost to fix each error: $50 (calls, credits, rework)
- Monthly error cost: $15,000

With EDI:
- Error rate: 0.1% = 10 errors
- Monthly error cost: $500
- **Savings: $14,500/month = $174,000/year**

**3. Cost Reduction:**

**Typical Savings:**

| Cost Category | Manual | EDI | Savings |
|--------------|--------|-----|---------|
| Order processing | $50-70/order | $1-5/order | 90%+ |

Management is considering voice picking technology costing $100,000 that would improve productivity to 80 lines per hour.
   - Calculate current daily labor cost
   - Calculate labor cost with voice picking
   - What is the payback period for the investment?

7. Create a simple DRP table for a retail store with the following data:
   - Forecast demand: 150 units per week for next 6 weeks
   - Current on-hand: 400 units
   - Lead time: 2 weeks
   - Safety stock: 100 units
   - Order quantity: 300 units
   - Show planned order releases

8. A company ships 500 orders per month to a particular city. Each order averages 200 kg. LTL cost is $1.50/kg. FTL cost is $2,000 per truck (capacity 20,000 kg). Should the company ship LTL or consolidate to FTL? Show calculations.

9. Compare the total cost of the following transportation options for shipping 1,000 kg of electronics worth $500,000 from China to Bangladesh:
   - **Option A:** Sea freight $200, transit time 25 days
   - **Option B:** Air freight $3,000, transit time 3 days
   - Inventory carrying cost: 20% annually
   - Which option is cheaper considering inventory in transit?

**Critical Thinking Questions:**

10. "EDI is too expensive and complex for small and medium enterprises in Bangladesh." Discuss this statement. Do you agree or disagree? What alternatives might be appropriate for SMEs?

11. Analyze why Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP) has not been widely adopted in Bangladesh's FMCG sector despite its theoretical benefits. What specific barriers exist, and how might they be overcome?

12. A company is deciding between operating its own warehouse or using a 3PL. The owned warehouse requires $2 million investment and $500,000 annual operating cost. The 3PL charges $8 per order. Annual volume is 80,000 orders, growing 10% per year.
    - Which option is better financially in Year 1? Year 3? Year 5?
    - What non-financial factors should influence the decision?
    - Make a recommendation with justification.

13. Design an integrated logistics strategy for an online grocery delivery company launching in Dhaka. Address:
    - Warehouse location and operations
