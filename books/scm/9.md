## 9.1 Introduction: The Strategic Role of Supplier Management

### 9.1.1 Why Supplier Management Matters

**Supplier management** encompasses all activities involved in identifying, selecting, developing, and maintaining relationships with suppliers to ensure optimal supply chain performance.

**Strategic Significance:**

Companies typically spend **50-70% of their revenue** on purchased goods and services, making supplier management a critical driver of:

- **Cost competitiveness:** Procurement costs directly impact profitability
- **Quality:** Supplier quality determines product quality
- **Innovation:** Suppliers contribute ideas and capabilities
- **Speed:** Supplier responsiveness affects time-to-market
- **Risk:** Supplier failures can disrupt operations

**Example Impact:**

```
Company Revenue: $100 million
Purchased Goods/Services: $60 million (60%)
Operating Profit: $8 million (8% margin)

SCENARIO: 5% reduction in procurement costs through better supplier management
Savings: $60M × 5% = $3 million
New Profit: $8M + $3M = $11 million
Profit Increase: 37.5%

This demonstrates supplier management's direct impact on bottom line
```

### 9.1.2 Evolution of Supplier Management

**Historical Progression:**

| Era | Approach | Characteristics | Supplier Relationship |
|-----|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Pre-1980s** | Purchasing | Administrative, clerical function | Adversarial, price-focused |
| **1980s-1990s** | Procurement | Strategic focus emerges | Multiple suppliers, competitive bidding |
| **1990s-2000s** | Supply Management | Integration with operations | Supplier partnerships begin |
| **2000s-Present** | Strategic Sourcing | Value creation focus | Collaborative, long-term |
| **Future** | Supply Chain Orchestration | Network management | Ecosystem partnerships |

**Modern Perspective:**

```
TRADITIONAL VIEW:
Suppliers = Vendors to be squeezed on price
Relationship = Transactional, short-term
Goal = Minimize purchase price

STRATEGIC VIEW:
Suppliers = Partners in value creation
Relationship = Collaborative, strategic
Goal = Optimize total cost of ownership + value contribution
```

### 9.1.4 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Effective supplier management looks beyond purchase price to **Total Cost of Ownership**.

**TCO Components:**

```
TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

PRE-TRANSACTION COSTS
├── Supplier search and qualification
├── Evaluation and selection
└── Contract negotiation

TRANSACTION COSTS
├── Purchase price
├── Order processing
├── Transportation and logistics
├── Customs and duties (imports)
└── Receiving and inspection

POST-TRANSACTION COSTS
├── Quality issues (defects, returns)
├── Inventory holding costs
├── Warranty and service
├── Disposal or recycling
└── Risk costs (delays, disruptions)
```

**TCO Example:**

**Comparing Two Suppliers:**

| Cost Element | Supplier A (Low Price) | Supplier B (Higher Price) |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Purchase price** | $10.00/unit | $11.00/unit |
| **Transportation** | $0.80/unit (overseas) | $0.30/unit (regional) |
| **Quality issues** | 3% defect rate = $0.30 | 0.5% defect rate = $0.05 |
| **Lead time inventory** | 60 days = $0.50 holding cost | 10 days = $0.10 |
| **Administrative** | $0.20 (complex ordering) | $0.05 (integrated systems) |
| **Risk premium** | $0.30 (supply instability) | $0.10 (reliable) |
| **TOTAL COST** | **$12.10/unit** | **$11.60/unit** |

**Decision:** Supplier B offers **4% lower TCO** despite 10% higher purchase price.

**Key Insight:** *The cheapest price is not always the lowest cost.*

```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Our requirement: 10,000 units/month
Supplier capacity: 50,000 units/month
Current total orders: 45,000 units/month

Available capacity: 5,000 units/month
Utilization with our business: (45,000 + 10,000) / 50,000 = 110%

CONCLUSION: Supplier currently CANNOT meet our requirements
Options: Supplier must expand capacity OR we split order
```

#### **6. Location**

**Approach:** Evaluate suppliers on each criterion with simple categories.

**Rating Scale:**

```
EXCELLENT (3 points)
GOOD (2 points)
ACCEPTABLE (1 point)
UNACCEPTABLE (0 points)
```

**Example:**

| Criterion | Supplier A | Supplier B | Supplier C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Quality | Excellent (3) | Good (2) | Excellent (3) |
| Cost | Good (2) | Excellent (3) | Acceptable (1) |
| Delivery | Good (2) | Good (2) | Good (2) |
| Financial | Excellent (3) | Acceptable (1) | Good (2) |
| **Total** | **10** | **8** | **8** |

**Advantages:**
- Simple, easy to understand
- Quick screening method
- Good for initial shortlisting

**Disadvantages:**
- All criteria weighted equally
- Subjective ratings
- Limited granularity

#### **Method 2: Weighted Point Method**

**Approach:** Assign weights to criteria based on importance, score suppliers, calculate weighted total.

**Example:**

**Step 1: Assign Weights (total = 100%)**

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Quality | 30% |
| Cost | 25% |
| Delivery | 20% |
| Financial Stability | 10% |
| Capability | 10% |
| CSR | 5% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

**Step 2: Score Each Supplier (scale 1-10)**

| Criterion | Weight | Supplier A Score | Supplier B Score | Supplier C Score |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Quality | 30% | 9 | 7 | 8 |
| Cost | 25% | 6 | 9 | 7 |
| Delivery | 20% | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| Financial | 10% | 9 | 6 | 8 |
| Capability | 10% | 8 | 7 | 7 |
| CSR | 5% | 7 | 6 | 8 |

**Step 3: Calculate Weighted Scores**

| Supplier | Calculation | **Total Score** |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Supplier A** | (9×0.30) + (6×0.25) + (8×0.20) + (9×0.10) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.05) | **7.75** |
| **Supplier B** | (7×0.30) + (9×0.25) + (8×0.20) + (6×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (6×0.05) | **7.65** |
| **Supplier C** | (8×0.30) + (7×0.25) + (9×0.20) + (8×0.10) + (7×0.10) + (8×0.05) | **7.95** |

**Decision:** Supplier C scores highest (7.95), though Supplier B offers best cost.

**Advantages:**
- Reflects relative importance of criteria
- Quantitative comparison
- Transparent decision-making

**Disadvantages:**
- Weight assignment can be subjective
- May give false precision
- Scores can be influenced by scorer bias

**Best Practice:** Use team evaluation, average scores, sensitivity analysis on weights.

#### **Method 3: Cost-Ratio Method**

**Approach:** Convert all criteria to costs, compare total cost.

**Example:**

**Base Information:**
- Annual purchase volume: 100,000 units
- Purchase price varies by supplier

**Supplier Cost Comparison:**

| Cost Element | Supplier A | Supplier B | Supplier C |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Purchase price** | $10.00/unit | $9.50/unit | $10.50/unit |
| **Base cost** | $1,000,000 | $950,000 | $1,050,000 |
| | | | |
| **Quality cost (defect rate)** | 2% = $20,000 | 4% = $38,000 | 1% = $10,500 |
| **Late delivery cost** | 5% late × $50/order × 200 orders = $5,000 | 10% late × $50 × 200 = $10,000 | 3% late × $50 × 200 = $3,000 |
| **Extra inventory (long lead time)** | Standard | +$15,000 | -$5,000 (shorter) |
| **Administrative (complex)** | Standard | +$8,000 | -$2,000 (streamlined) |
| | | | |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | **$1,025,000** | **$1,021,000** | **$1,056,500** |

**Cost per unit:**
- Supplier A: $10.25
- Supplier B: $10.21
- Supplier C: $10.57

**Decision:** Supplier B offers lowest total cost despite mid-range pricing.

**Advantages:**
- Focuses on what matters most (cost)
- Converts qualitative to quantitative
- Clear financial justification

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to monetize some factors (innovation, strategic fit)
- Requires good cost data
- May undervalue intangibles

#### **Method 4: Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)**

**Approach:** Sophisticated pairwise comparison method that determines relative importance through systematic comparisons.

**Process:**

1. Define criteria and sub-criteria hierarchy
2. Pairwise comparison of criteria importance
3. Pairwise comparison of suppliers on each criterion
4. Calculate weights and scores mathematically
5. Aggregate for overall ranking

**Advantages:**
- Rigorous, structured methodology
- Handles complex decisions with many criteria
- Consistency checking

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex, time-consuming

TARGET: 500 PPM (0.05%)

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM:
Week 1-2: Root cause analysis (buyer's quality team + supplier)
Week 3-4: Implement process controls (SPC charts, mistake-proofing)
Week 5-8: Train operators, refine processes
Week 9-12: Monitor, adjust, stabilize
Result: Defect rate reduced to 600 PPM, continuing improvement

INVESTMENT: Buyer's team time (~200 hours), training materials (~$5,000)
BENEFIT: Fewer defects, lower inspection costs, better relationship
```

**3. Capital Investment:**

Sometimes buyer invests in supplier's equipment or facility.

**Example:**

```
SITUATION: Supplier lacks capacity for projected volume growth

OPTIONS:
A. Find new supplier (costly, time-consuming, risk)
B. Help current supplier expand

BUYER DECISION: Loan $500,000 for supplier to buy additional equipment
TERMS: Interest-free, repaid through $0.05/unit cost reduction over 5 years
RESULT: Supplier gains capacity, buyer secures supply, both benefit
```

**4. Technology Transfer:**

Buyer shares technology, processes, or intellectual property.

**Example:**

## 9.5 Evaluating Supplier Alternatives

### 9.5.1 Make vs. Buy Decision

Fundamental choice: Should we produce internally or buy from suppliers?

**Make (Vertical Integration):**

**Advantages:**

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Control** | Direct oversight of quality, schedule, costs |
| **Confidentiality** | Protect proprietary processes, IP |
| **Avoid supplier power** | No dependency on external supplier |
| **Capture profits** | Keep supplier's margin |
| **Guaranteed capacity** | Not competing for supplier capacity |

**Disadvantages:**

| Disadvantage | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Capital investment** | Must invest in equipment, facilities, people |
| **Fixed costs** | Capacity costs even when not fully utilized |
| **Lack of expertise** | May not be as efficient as specialist supplier |
| **Opportunity cost** | Resources tied up, can't focus on core competencies |
| **Inflexibility** | Harder to scale up/down |

**Buy (Outsource):**

**Advantages:**

- Access specialist expertise
- Variable cost structure (pay for what you use)
- No capital investment required
- Flexibility to scale
- Focus on core competencies
- Access to supplier's innovation

**Disadvantages:**

- Less control
- Dependency risk
- IP/confidentiality concerns
- Coordination complexity
- Supplier's margin included in price

**Decision Framework:**

```
MAKE IF:
✓ Core competency (strategic importance)
✓ Confidential/proprietary
✓ Suppliers unreliable or limited
✓ High volume (economies of scale)
✓ Existing internal capacity

BUY IF:
✓ Non-core activity
✓ Limited internal expertise
✓ Suppliers more efficient
✓ Low volume (can't achieve scale)
✓ Capital constraints
✓ Need flexibility
```

**Example:**

**Company:** Electronics manufacturer

**Decision:** Make or buy printed circuit boards (PCBs)?

```
MAKE ANALYSIS:
Investment: $5 million for SMT line
Annual volume: 100,000 boards
Internal cost: $30/board (materials + labor + overhead allocation)
Total annual cost: $3 million + $1 million amortized investment = $4 million

BUY ANALYSIS:
Supplier quote: $38/board
Total annual cost: $3.8 million
No capital investment

FINANCIAL: Buy saves $200,000/year initially

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- PCBs are not core competency (company's strength is product design)
- Technology changing rapidly (investment may become obsolete)
- Volume may fluctuate (fixed costs risky)
- Multiple capable suppliers available

DECISION: BUY from supplier, focus resources on product innovation
```

### 9.5.2 Single vs. Multiple Sourcing

- May reduce service level

COMPLACENCY:
- No competitive pressure
- Innovation may slow
- Efficiency improvements may stall
```

**Multiple Sourcing Advantages:**

```
RISK MITIGATION:
- One supplier fails, others cover
- Disaster impacts only portion of supply
- Diversification

COMPETITION:
- Suppliers compete on price, service
- Maintains competitive tension
- Benchmarking one against another

CAPACITY:
- Combined capacity exceeds single supplier
- Flexibility during demand spikes
```

**Multiple Sourcing Disadvantages:**

```
DILUTED VOLUME:
- Each supplier gets less volume

- Higher per-unit prices

COMPLEXITY:
- More suppliers to manage
- Inconsistent quality possible
- Higher administrative costs

SHALLOW RELATIONSHIPS:
- Harder to build partnerships with multiple suppliers
- Less supplier commitment
- Limited collaboration
```

**Recommendation by Item Type:**

| Item Characteristic | Sourcing Strategy |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Commodity, standard** | Multiple (2-3) for competition |
| **Custom, complex** | Single for consistency, but maintain qualified backup |
| **Critical, high-value** | Dual source (70/30 split) |
| **Strategic partnership** | Single, but with robust contingency plan |
| **New, uncertain volume** | Multiple initially, consolidate later |

**Dual Sourcing (70/30 or 80/20):**

```
BALANCED APPROACH:

PRIMARY SUPPLIER (70-80%):
- Gets majority of volume
- Partnership relationship
- Price and service advantages
- Collaborative improvement

SECONDARY SUPPLIER (20-30%):
- Qualified and capable
- Maintains competitive pressure
- Backup capacity ready
- Can scale up if primary fails

BENEFITS:
- Relationship advantages of single sourcing
- Risk mitigation of multiple sourcing
- Competitive discipline maintained
```

**Total Cost Comparison:**

```
LOCAL SUPPLIER:
Unit price: $100
Transportation: $5
Lead time: 1 week → Inventory cost: $2
Quality/rework: 2% defect rate = $2
Communication/management: $1
Risk premium: $1
TOTAL: $111/unit

GLOBAL SUPPLIER (e.g., China):
Unit price: $70 (30% lower)
Transportation: $15 (container shipping)
Lead time: 6 weeks → Inventory cost: $12 (pipeline + safety stock)
Quality/rework: 3% defect = $2.10
Communication/management: $3 (language, time zones, visits)
Currency risk: $2
Risk premium: $5 (geopolitical, IP)
TOTAL: $109.10/unit

SAVINGS: $1.90/unit (1.7%) but with significantly higher risk and complexity
```

**Decision Factors:**

```
FAVOR LOCAL IF:
- Short product lifecycle (fashion, electronics)
- Customization or complexity (easier collaboration)

- Challenges: Port congestion, customs delays, LC requirements

**As Exporter:**
- Garments to EU, USA (GSP benefits)
- Pharmaceuticals to developing countries
- Agricultural products regionally

**Trend:** "China + 1" strategy—global buyers diversifying from China, Bangladesh benefits

### 9.5.4 Supplier Rationalization

**Supplier rationalization** is the strategic process of optimizing the supplier base—often reducing the number of suppliers.

**Why Rationalize:**

```
COMMON PROBLEM:
- Company has 500+ suppliers
- Top 20 suppliers = 80% of spend
- Bottom 400 suppliers = 20% of spend but 60% of management effort
- Each supplier requires: POs, invoices, audits, relationships, problem-solving
```

**Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):**

```
TYPICAL SUPPLIER DISTRIBUTION:

20% of suppliers → 80% of spend → FOCUS HERE
80% of suppliers → 20% of spend → RATIONALIZE
```

**Rationalization Benefits:**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Cost reduction** | Volume leverage with fewer suppliers, better pricing |
| **Improved quality** | Focus on fewer, better suppliers |
| **Lower admin costs** | Fewer transactions, invoices, contracts |
| **Stronger relationships** | More volume per supplier enables partnerships |
| **Reduced complexity** | Simpler supplier management |
| **Better compliance** | Easier to audit, monitor fewer suppliers |

**Rationalization Process:**

```
STEP 1: ANALYZE SPEND
- Categorize all purchases
- Identify spend by supplier
- Map supplier count by category

STEP 2: SEGMENT SUPPLIERS
- Strategic (critical, high spend)
- Preferred (important, medium spend)
- Transactional (commodity, low spend)
- Non-strategic (tail spend)

STEP 3: SET TARGETS
Example: Reduce from 500 to 200 suppliers over 2 years
- Eliminate 200 tail suppliers (consolidate into distributor)
- Consolidate 100 similar suppliers into 20 preferred
- Maintain/deepen relationships with 20 strategic

STEP 4: EXECUTE
- Communicate with suppliers (some will be exited)
- Consolidate volumes with remaining suppliers
- Negotiate better terms based on increased volume
- Transition management (avoid disruption)

STEP 5: SUSTAIN
- Supplier approval process (prevent proliferation)
- Regular portfolio review
- Continuous optimization
```

**Example:**

**Before Rationalization:**
- 300 suppliers for MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Operations) items
- Average order value: $500
- Administrative cost per order: $75
- Annual orders: 6,000
- Admin cost: 6,000 × $75 = $450,000

**After Rationalization:**
- 3 preferred MRO distributors (each carries multiple brands)
- Average order value: $5,000 (consolidated)
- Administrative cost per order: $75
- Annual orders: 600
- Admin cost: 600 × $75 = $45,000
- **Savings: $405,000 (90% reduction)**

Plus: Volume leverage with 3 distributors → 10-15% price reduction

**Caution:**

Don't over-rationalize:
- Maintain competition (avoid over-dependence)
- Keep backup suppliers qualified for critical items
- Preserve capabilities (some small suppliers have unique value)

## Review Questions

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. Explain why Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is a better metric than purchase price alone for supplier selection. Provide three examples of costs beyond purchase price.

2. Compare and contrast transactional supplier relationships with strategic partnerships. Under what circumstances is each appropriate?

3. What is the purpose of supplier audits? Describe three types of audits and their focus areas.

4. Explain the "make vs. buy" decision. What factors favor internal production versus outsourcing?

5. Why might a company choose dual sourcing (70/30 split) instead of single sourcing or equal multi-sourcing?

**Application Questions:**

6. Use the weighted point method to evaluate three suppliers with the following data:

| Criterion | Weight | Supplier A | Supplier B | Supplier C |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Quality | 35% | 9 | 7 | 8 |
| Cost | 30% | 6 | 9 | 7 |
| Delivery | 20% | 8 | 7 | 9 |
| Financial | 15% | 8 | 6 | 9 |

Which supplier scores highest? By how much?

7. Compare total cost for local vs. global sourcing:

**Local Supplier:**
- Unit price: $50
- Transportation: $2/unit
- Lead time: 1 week
- Defect rate: 1%

**Global Supplier:**
- Unit price: $35
- Transportation: $8/unit
- Lead time: 6 weeks (inventory carrying cost 20%/year)
- Defect rate: 2%

Annual volume: 10,000 units
Cost of defects: $20/unit

Calculate total annual cost for each. Which is better?

8. A company has 400 suppliers with the following spend distribution:
- Top 20 suppliers: 70% of spend ($70 million)
- Next 80 suppliers: 20% of spend ($20 million)
- Bottom 300 suppliers: 10% of spend ($10 million)

Administrative cost per supplier: $5,000/year

They plan to rationalize to 150 suppliers by consolidating the bottom 300 into 50. Calculate administrative cost savings.

**Critical Thinking Questions:**

9. A garment buyer from Europe wants to source from Bangladesh but is concerned about social compliance after the Rana Plaza tragedy. As a supplier, what steps would you take to demonstrate compliance and build trust? Design a comprehensive compliance program.

10. Your company currently single-sources a critical electronic component from a supplier in China. Recent geopolitical tensions and COVID-19 disruptions have exposed risks. Evaluate options:
- Option A: Continue single sourcing but with stricter contracts
- Option B: Develop a local supplier (will take 18 months, 15% higher cost)
- Option C: Dual source (70% China, 30% Vietnam)
Make a recommendation with justification considering cost, risk, and strategic factors.

11. Analyze the statement: "Supplier partnerships sound good in theory but rarely work in practice because buyer and supplier interests are fundamentally opposed—buyer wants low prices, supplier wants high prices." Do you agree or disagree? Defend your position with examples.

12. A pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh wants to upgrade local raw material suppliers to international quality standards. Design a 2-year supplier development program including:
- Assessment criteria
- Development activities
- Investment requirements
- Success metrics
- Risk mitigation

## Case Study: Square Pharmaceuticals Supplier Management Transformation

**Background:**

Square Pharmaceuticals Limited (SPL), Bangladesh's leading pharmaceutical company, faces growing pressure to improve supplier management as it expands exports to regulated markets (EU, North America, Australia).

**Current State:**

**Supplier Base:**
- 150+ suppliers of raw materials (APIs, excipients)
- 50+ packaging suppliers
- 30+ service providers (equipment, maintenance, logistics)
- Mix of local (40%) and imported (60%)

**Challenges:**

**1. Quality Issues:**
- API defect rate: 3% (international standard: <0.5%)
- Packaging errors causing product recalls
- Inconsistent quality from local suppliers
- Limited quality systems at supplier sites

**2. Supply Disruptions:**
- 15% of orders delivered late
- Lead time variability ±7 days (±2 days target)
- Several instances of complete stockouts
- Dependency on single sources for critical APIs

**3. Cost Pressures:**
- Procurement costs 55% of revenue (benchmark: 50%)
- Transportation costs high (frequent small shipments)
- Quality-related costs (inspection, rework, returns): 2% of spend
- Administrative costs: 300 person-days/year per supplier (high)

**4. Compliance Risks:**
- International buyers require supplier audits
- Many suppliers lack certifications (ISO, GMP)
- Traceability gaps (batch records incomplete)
- Environmental and social compliance unclear

**5. Innovation Gap:**
- Limited collaboration with suppliers on new products
- No early supplier involvement in development
- Slow to adopt new technologies/materials

**Strategic Objectives:**

The Board has set 3-year goals:
1. Achieve 99.5% supplier quality (defects <500 PPM)
2. Reduce procurement costs to 50% of revenue
3. Eliminate stockouts (99% on-time delivery)
4. 100% of critical suppliers certified and audit-ready
5. Enable export to EU (requires full traceability, audited supply chain)

**Questions for Analysis:**

**Part A: Supplier Segmentation and Strategy**

1. Design a supplier segmentation approach for SPL using the Kraljic matrix or similar framework. Categorize:
   - Critical APIs (limited sources, high value)
   - Standard packaging (many suppliers, medium spend)
   - Generic excipients (commodities)
   - Specialized equipment services

2. For each category, recommend appropriate relationship strategies (transactional, preferred, partnership). Justify your recommendations.

3. SPL currently has 150+ raw material suppliers. Recommend a target number and provide a rationalization strategy.

**Part B: Supplier Selection and Audit**

4. Develop comprehensive supplier selection criteria for API suppliers, considering:
   - Quality requirements (pharmaceutical-specific)
   - Regulatory compliance (WHO-GMP, ICH)
   - Financial stability
   - Technical capability
   - Geographic/geopolitical risks

Assign weights and create a scoring template.

5. Design a supplier audit program:
   - Audit types (quality, compliance, process)
   - Audit frequency by supplier type
   - Audit checklist for API supplier (minimum 20 items)
   - Finding classification and response protocol

**Part C: Supplier Development**

6. SPL wants to develop local packaging suppliers to substitute imports (currently 80% imported). Design a 24-month supplier development program:
   - Selection criteria for development candidates
   - Gap assessment methodology
   - Development activities (training, technology, investment)
   - Success metrics
   - Investment budget and ROI projection

7. Calculate the business case:
   - Current: Import packaging at $1.00/unit, lead time 60 days
   - Developed local supplier: $0.85/unit, lead time 7 days
   - Annual volume: 10 million units
   - Development investment: BDT 50 lakh
   - Inventory carrying cost: 25% per year

What is the payback period?

**Part D: Single vs. Multiple Sourcing**

8. SPL sources a critical API from a single supplier in India. This API is used in their top-selling product (30% of revenue). Evaluate options:
   - **Option A:** Continue single sourcing (strong relationship, best price)
   - **Option B:** Dual source 70/30 (add Chinese supplier)
   - **Option C:** Develop local API manufacturer (18-24 months, government support available)

For each option, assess:
   - Cost impact
   - Supply risk
   - Quality implications
   - Strategic fit

Make a recommendation with justification.

**Part E: Partnership Development**

9. SPL wants to develop strategic partnerships with 5 key suppliers. Design a partnership program:
   - Partnership selection criteria
   - Partnership agreement elements
   - Governance structure (joint teams, review frequency)
   - Shared metrics and incentives
   - Information sharing protocols
   - Exit strategy (what if partnership fails?)

10. Create a supplier scorecard for ongoing performance management:
    - Metrics for quality, delivery, cost, responsiveness, innovation
    - Weights for each metric
    - Target performance levels
    - Review frequency and escalation process
    - Link to business allocation decisions

**Part F: Implementation Roadmap**

11. Develop a comprehensive 3-year implementation roadmap:
    - **Year 1:** Foundation (assessment, rationalization, quick wins)
    - **Year 2:** Development (supplier programs, certifications)
    - **Year 3:** Optimization (partnerships, continuous improvement)

For each year, specify:
- Key initiatives
- Resource requirements
- Expected outcomes
- Risks and mitigation

12. Estimate total benefits:
    - Cost savings (procurement, quality, inventory, admin)
    - Risk reduction (stockout avoidance, compliance)
    - Revenue enablement (EU export capability)
    - Strategic value (innovation, speed to market)

Build business case for executive approval.

**Deliverables:**

Prepare a comprehensive supplier management transformation proposal including:

1. Executive Summary (2 pages)
2. Current State Assessment (problems quantified)
3. Supplier Segmentation and Strategy
4. Selection and Audit Programs
5. Supplier Development Plan
6. Sourcing Strategy Recommendations
7. Partnership Framework
8. Implementation Roadmap (3 years)
